Anyway, this was an awesome experience and it was so fun playing what felt like Zelda 1 all over again and not knowing anything about it. I can't say I'd recommend doing a blind playthrough for everyone since it requires a lot of patience, but I loved it. I'd been meaning to cross this one off my list for a while and it's immensely satisfying to have done so.",1588390753.0

gbzoeb,fpa0g5a,1,"FF1 is fantastic but a totally blind playthrough would be rough, I think. There are a few spots where I don't know how you'd figure it out without the guide, barring extreme amounts of patience.

gbzoeb,fp9k078,2,"Was 6 the one in the graveyard? I too did a 2nd quest run and had to look up that one, but I think I did everything else blind. I actually remembered the bomb across the river one from Nintendo power like 30 years ago, but not the graveyard one.",1588428135.0

gbzoeb,fpa0cra,1,Yeah they're mean for sure. Everything about 2Q is hardcore.,1588438258.0
gbzoeb,fpa06up,1,"Honestly, only 6 really gave me a hard time. I'm not sure why but I somehow instinctively knew where 7  & 8 were, or maybe it was just lucky guesses. I \*did\* essentially bomb every wall and burn every bush (after I got red candle anyway).",1588438165.0
gbzoeb,fpae4g8,1,I dunno I just had a feeling I guess? It seemed like something that'd be mean... and the game is super mean.,1588446271.0
gbzoeb,frw14s9,1,"Yeah Dungeon 6 is BS. I found Dungeon 8 by myself, but it's possible I had some latent memory of Nintendo Power or something because I just had a feeling there was a dungeon on the other side of that river. 

What I did to bomb a lot of places though was get a save that had 16 bombs, and spam bombs in a row and then die, don't save, and load my game with 16 bombs. It was surprisingly efficient.",1590513649.0
gbzoeb,fp9yzaq,2,Yeah that’s unusual.  The devs even said that it was really hard to figure out and that they intended people to work together.  (Probably just a copout for making it too esoteric),1588437466.0

I have that CRT and a JVC D-Series.  I find the Sony looks better with higher resolution things like text or 480i content while the JVC looks better with 240p.  Also, it seems the JVC's comb filter removes noise from straight composite better.

So I end up using the JVC for older gen games wand Sony for later retro games plus a PC via S-Video.",1588428748.0

The NES version is a fully 3d sandbox game that pushes the limits of the system so hard that it can only run on the 50 frames per second of the PAL format. 

It shouldn't be possible on a slow, tile based system, much less be any kind of upgrade.

5lcwvi,dbvbi8f,1,"Fairly sure some other people know this as well, but I almost never see it mentioned anywhere.

There's an oversight in *Secret of Mana* that allows you to waltz through the game virtually unopposed. It's technically not cheating either.

Typically, you cast offensive magic by playing as the Sprite (or the girl, later on), pressing Y, and selecting the magic you want to cast.

Your are unable to control the character while he/she is casting the magic, which takes a good few seconds.

However, you can also cast another character's magic by pressing the X button. Better yet, you can immediately cast another spell afterwards (as long as that character still has MP obviously).

So, the best way to play the game is to play as Randi (the boy) all the time, who is the most skilled at physical combat anyway, and *spam* enemies - boss characters included, save for the final one - with magic attacks. You can even queue magic attacks this way, and absolutely pummel any enemy into oblivion with them being able to do anything and take it. Better yet, while your party members are casting away, you can charge up powerful strikes without interruption.

I wonder how that made it through playtesting. I have a hard time believing it is a deliberate feature of the game.",1483288932.0

I would strongly recommend just rebuilding the original 1st party Nintendo connector using a modified paper clip, some good lighting, patience, and about 10 minutes of your time. Start at one end of the connector’s pins, pop the modified paper clip underneath the first pin, hold the front of the pin in place with your other hand, then slowly pull up and towards you with the clip (almost like you’re massaging the pin back into shape like a body man works a dent).

When you have the bottom pin nearly touching the top, then stop & move onto the next pin. Rinse. Repeat until you’re to the end.

CRT's won't last forever, nor will LCD televisions.  Just because they won't last forever doesn't mean they are inherently not worth using at all.

The primary reason I mentioned CRT televisions to begin with in this particular thread was less to do with price than with nostalgia.  As the OP himself noted:

>It would be a wonderful gift for my wife, this is the very first console she owned and has a lot of emotional value to her.

There is obviously more to this than just wanting to being able to play a few rounds of Battletoads again.  The console itself is important to her, so presumably, the memories she has of the time she spent playing games on the console (which would almost certainly have been on a tube TV) would also have meaning to her.

The OP obviously thinks that having a WORKING console is an important consideration, so it stands to reason that being able to actually play NES games on that particular console is probably an important part of her emotional attachment to the system.  So I don't think it is a stretch to suggest that having a CRT TV on which to play that console would likely add to that experience in a positive way.

The fact that it might also cost less than a converter box is a largely secondary consideration.",1666239613.0

>How'd you get into game collecting?

I’ve always collected something. From an early age it was pennies, rocks, keys, baseball hats and so on. Displaying and acquiring “collectable” items has always been part of my personality. I’ve also been gaming from a young age. I was never a kid who traded in games when I was done with them, I’d just stick them on my shelf. Everything changed for me when I came across classic gaming forums. I was amazed at the amount of people who were still passionate about these dusty old systems and games. This really sparked my interest. From there I began searching out games online, at thrift stores and garage sales.

>What are your favorites to collect for?

That’s always changing. I have a soft spot in my heart for the NES, since it was my primary system as a child. Gamecube has been really interesting for me as well. As far a Nintendo Consoles go, not a ton of people collect for Gamecube, so in a way it’s been uncharted territory. Currently I’m concentrating on completing a Game Boy set.

>What are some of your gems?

Hmm… I’ve been lucky enough to acquire many of the rares for the different systems. I’m a guy that goes for complete sets, so I have a bit of everything.

As you could guess from my user name I particularly enjoy Nintendo. So maybe not hidden gems or rare titles. But any game with Mario, Metroid or Zelda in it and I’m a happy guy.

>What do you think is the coolest thing about your sub?

The community is fantastic, knowledgeable, friendly and won’t hesitate to help you out. It’s a great place to share your collection, latest finds and thoughts on the future of retro collecting. 

Informationator already mentioned the 3-Minute challenge. That’s pretty neat too it’s a great way to experience these classic games in a new, competitive way.

Peace :)",1399403732.0
24r26z,ch9ubqm,3,">Readers are encouraged to share their experience with the game collecting and ask questions about the hobby.

I'll go first. I once loaned part of my collection out to an exhibit, and the Arizona Republic called me for an interview. The girl had her young daughter who was crying. I guess it distracted her from her notes, so my responses came out to be a little silly sounding. 

The true answer is that one of my earliest memories was playing *Missile Command* with my dad when I was about four. That console was stolen when I was about five, so I didn't get a lot of time with it, but it had a big impression one me. I loved video games. 

When I started grade school NES was soaring in popularity. I made new friends and they had this console. It was awesome. My family couldn't afford an NES, but I played all of the classics at the houses of my friends. 

When I was nine my family moved across the country. All I had wanted all year was a Super Nintendo. But my new friends all had a Sega Genesis, so that's what I asked for for Christmas, and that's what I got. In fact, that model 1 is sitting next to my right now, packed in its original box. 

I didn't have a lot of games, but every 90s kid knows that video rental stores were a big things. So while I only ever owned eight Genesis games as a kid, through the magic of rentals and borrowing from my friends, I played most of them. 

From then on I was a big Sega fan. When the 32X came out it was right after my parents divorced, and my mom worked an extra job to get it for me for Christmas. I didn't even get a game for it until my birthday, but it was awesome. 

The next Christmas was the first after my dad died. That year is was a Saturn. I eventually got a NetLink, and through it the awe and wonder of the world wide web and online gaming. I got into gaming communities big time. Wrote for online gaming sites, got to review unreleased software and go to E3. Dreamcast was the first new console I bought for myself. 

I am getting ahead of story, though. Rewinding... When I was 17 I had a job and a car. Game collecting wasn't a big thing yet, so even rare games were pennies at pawn shows and swap meets, and they were abundant. I once paid a dollar for a moving box full of Atari 2600 games. 

I got into collecting out of nostalgia. I bought an Atari 2600, an NES and the games I played at my friends houses, and then all of those Genesis games I rented, and all those cool ones I read about in EGM but couldn't afford. 

Then I got more into it and learned about the history of gaming. I got an Odyssey, a Channel F. I learned about this bad ass console called Vectrex, so I got one of those too. 

And I still collect to this day. 

I love reading the responses from the team over at /r/gamecollecting because when you talk to collectors you learn something new, even if you're like me and you think you already know almost everything. I didn't even know about the Super Wide Boy before today. 

That's why when I was new to Reddit the first subs other than the defaults that I sought out and subscribed to were related to old school gaming, including this sub as well as /r/gamecollecting. 

I've found that other game collectors are some of the nicest people I've ever met, and I think that's really reflected in both this sub and on /r/gamecollecting. 

That's probably enough from me. 

I've posted this before, but here's my entire collection... Well, most of it.

When you persistently made alt account after alt account for weeks and still send me angry messages out of the blue many months after the fact, you are confirming that the mod team's unanimous decision to remove you from our community was the right call.

I've conveyed to you before that I am sorry I put you in the position I put you in by using your name instead of simply addressing the legal issues without using your name.  Beyond that, you are responsible for your own actions and their consequences - in what you decide to build a business around and in what you do on Reddit.  Those actions got you banned when we otherwise would've welcomed you to continue using our community as we have many others who were unhappy with the rules but managed to weather the changes with maturity.

The same reason my site got banned, you said yourself that you guys didn't want the site to ""poach"" ""your"" users when all I was trying to do was setup an actual website, which you gave me permission to do, so we need not worry posts and pics were lost in the ether. But you added it to the spam filter anyways once it started getting users, the same users that visit both the site and the sub and were using them both jointly. Personally, r/GC is an awesome sub.

tyfokv,i3s9jbn,3,"As someone growing up in the UK in the 1980s, the NES had absolutely zero impact on my early gaming experiences, and NOBODY I know has ever owned one.  Gaming on home computers dominated the UK gaming scene throughout the 1980s ... I went from an Atari VCS (aka Atari 2600) console in 1980 to a Sinclair ZX81 computer, then an Atari 400, then a 48K ZX Spectrum, then an Amstrad CPC464, before going up to a 16-bit platform with the Atari 520 STFM in 1988.  The home computer market was in constant evolution and by the time the NES was launched here in 1987, my peer group were already looking at or owned 16-bit computer platforms.

The NES suffered from underwhelming child's toy marketing, which held little interest for older gamers and put-off parents weighing up the choice between buying a multi-purpose computer or just an expensive toy for their kids.

While Nintendo struggled to break into the UK market with the NES, SEGA were able to establish a console foothold in the UK videogame market at the end of the 80s with the Master System, partly because of edgier marketing that had wider impact.  Once the console market had been established, the NES was able to generate a mainly young userbase into the 90s, alongside Nintendo launching the Game Boy which also grew Nintendo's reputation and market-share.

From my perspective it wasn't really until the Super Nintendo released in the UK in 1992 that Nintendo became a major player here, rivalling not only the SEGA Mega Drive (aka Genesis), but also the Commodore Amiga home computer that was then dominating the 16-bit home computer market.",1649351358.0

When it came to buying my CPC464 I was already working while living with my parents so had a decent amount of spare income, and my Atari ST was largely paid for from a bonus I got from work so it didnt really cost me much at all.  You have to realise that the computer market evolved quite aggressively here, with prices of systems and between rival retailers continually undercutting each other to establish themselves, while the tech was constantly moving forwards with new systems launching continuously.

I think the early 80s home computer market in North America was quite different to here in the UK.  From what I've seen, the US market was very much focused on having a high quality product and paying a premium price for it ... whereas the UK home computer scene was really initiated as budget priced kits for hobbyists to build at home, such as the Sinclair ZX80 & ZX81.  Because the market here started with a low price of entry, higher-end products from Atari and Commodore that were ridiculously more expensive struggled initially to get a foothold, such as the Atari 400/800 or Commodore's VIC-20/C64. As the UK home computer market developed, numerous price drops of the C64 made it much more competitive to the mainstream audience where it's comparatively high-end specs made it one of the market leaders here alongside the 48k ZX Spectrum from Sinclair.  A quick search online has come up with an article pricing the 48k ZX Spectrum in 1983 at £129.95, while the C64 was priced at £345 ... almost 3 times the price.  By late 1984 the C64 had already dropped in price to £199 standalone, or £249 with some peripherals thrown in too.  [HERE](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/11900/how-did-the-sinclair-compare-on-price-with-the-c64-in-the-uk) is a link to the article if you're interested.",1649412423.0
tyfokv,i40pqp0,2,"Remember that the sorts of computers that the UK market focused on had more British-designed ""cheap and cheerful"" models like the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC, which were made to a price, while there was also an emphasis on distribution of games on cassette tapes, dropping the prices dramatically over cartridge games.

Once established, the home computer gaming industry just continued to expand throughout the 1980s as the market and technology evolved.  Likewise, the 1990s saw a similar transition back in the other direction towards console gaming, as the home computer market gave way to PCs that were much more expensive.

38jpyj,crvmcsn,3,"Cool idea. I'll do mine as kind of a continuum. 

1. Combat - Atari 2600 (1977): The game is the very basis of how games can be fun based on gameplay mechanics alone. There are a ton of variations on this cart. With a friend or group of friends this is a lot of fun. 

2. Ms. Pac-Man - Arcade (1981): Pac-Man may be the O.G. but his lady is where it's at. The formula is perfect here. The game is the perfect blend of simplicity and 

3. Tetris - Game Boy (1989): Sure, there are better versions of Tetris out there. But this is the first one that popularized the game, and it also founded Nintendo's handheld empire. 

4. Super Mario World - SNES (1990): Super Mario Bros. on NES is a good game, so is Super Mario Bros. 3, but I think Super Mario World is where the formula was really perfected. The gameplay and graphics hold up well today. It's the most essential retro Mario game as far as I am concerned. 

5. Shining Force II - Genesis (1993): Shining Force was outstanding. Shining Force II is even better. This game remains one of the best strategy/tactical RPGs of all time. Ya, it's better than Final Fantasy Tactics. If I were to introduce someone into this genre, this would be the game I'd tell them to play. 

5. DOOM - PC-DOS (1993): Not the first FPS ever, but one of the most important. It was genre defining and its impact on games has been lasting. It's still fun and it gives me anxiety when playing it. I've never been scared by a game before unless I am afraid to die. This game makes me afraid to die. 

6. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles - Genesis (1994): I wish Sega used their Lock-On Technology for more games than just this one. Originally, this was meant to be a single game, but it was broken into two. Combined they are hands down the best Sonic game of all time. It's by far the biggest, most complex, and best looking of the original series. Also the most fun. 

7. Mortal Kombat Trilogy - N64/PlayStation/Saturn (1996): Mortal Kombat might not be the best fighter. But it sure is fun. Trilogy is the best of the classic series, combining all of the characters from each game into one. The N64 version is the best here due to the lack of loading times. 

8. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night - PlayStation (1997): Castlevania is one of the most classic games in history. This version also happens to be undisputedly the best game in the franchise, and some would say the best game on PlayStation. Some might argue that the Saturn version is better due to having extra characters and features, but it wasn't ever released in English, so I am sticking with the PSX version. 

9. Panzer Dragoon Saga - Saturn (1998): This RPG is simply the best game ever made in the history of ever. 'Nuff said.

1. **Super Mario World** - Without the obvious, the map and all it secrets makes it uniqe to this day.

I dabbled with SOTN, but it was just too different for me.  I've never really been able to get into RPG type elements, so that was a big part of it.   

I liked Super Metroid, and people are always saying that SOTN shares a lot with Super Metroid, but I guess the things that SOTN shares with Super Metroid, are the things about Super Metroid that I don't really care about?  I dunno.",1468705080.0
4t3jzv,d5fi6vw,1,"Super Castlevania IV did address the complaints about the earlier games that it true but i think it was an overcorrection.

i have to admit that it feels very refreshing and fluid the way they changed the jumps and the whip but it completely breaks the game. The controls are good and better than in the previous titles according to most, and playing through this game is very fun but i just cannot help but mention how so many of this games’ enemies are redundant because of the new 8 direction whip. Plus the sub-weapons became totally useless... They should have thought about that more

I hope you get my point and how i feel like this breaks the game. Because of this i almost never died because i lost all my health. 95% of my deaths were pits, spikes or other one shot death dangers. I didn’t like that very much, mainly because i like the fighting aspect of Castlevania a lot more than the platforming aspect. There is this mudman early in the game that does nothing but take your time, he is so slow that he will never ever be able to damage you, but when you hit him he splits into many more little mudmen and the SNES starts to lag a lot. Boring enemy that makes you lag… I don’t like that either.

That being said i still like the game plays well and feels fluid and fun. It is also pretty long with 11 stages who are very diverse in environment.

I talk about this all in my review of the game i made a few months ago :p

 5.Super Castlevania IV 4. Bloodlines 3. Castlevania 2. Rondo of Blood 1. Dracula's Curse

It's just hard to pick a ""favorite"" Castlevania game because they all are truly great games (speaking of classic and Metroidvania titles only). I think that the first and third games in the series had the best fighting/combat mechanics, I really did enjoy the classic boss fights where you had to recognize patterns or pick which weapon you need to keep for the boss at the end, that was probably my favorite element of the older/classic games, Rondo did a great job at that. I understand the huge change in difficulty and how it may turn some players off. I really agree with your point that nearly EVERY death in the game was caused by jumping or spikes, not enemies or boss fights, and that kind of took away from the experience, as well as the sub weapons being rendered useless.

The battles will become harder and may require more strategy.  Enemies will start to have weaknesses to certain magic types.  Conversely, they will actually heal from the wrong magic.  Random Encounters will probably continue to be a pain.  In some areas, it felt like they happened every couple steps, especially toward the end of IV.  As for the gameplay, I think I prefered IV in just about every respect except for the graphics.  VI is a beautiful game with amazing music.  The combat system was interesting in VI, but at times it felt a little too wild with every character having a different skill set, and some of them being utterly useless most of the time. (I'm looking at you Mog...)  As for your last question, I don't think I was ever really concerned, going into a fight or area, about gear.

It's usually just a matter of buying the most expensive stuff, doing the most damage, and having enough recovery items to restore yourself.  If you find yourself getting beaten, you're not leveled enough for the area.  That's about it.  One thing I will say is that the boss fights in IV seem to be a lot less forgiving, the Mount Ordeals boss fights for instance.  I did like VI's magic system though, it's basically the same as the job system from V, but with magic instead of classes.


Secret of Mana:
I'm assuming that when you say Secret of Mana II, you're talking about Seiken Densetsu III.  I was almost to the end, but never finished it.  While I feel it was way ahead of its time, I simply didn't find it as enjoyable as the first one.  Secret of Mana remains one of my most favorite games of all time, although it may just be one of the most broken RPGs out there.  The combat can be downright unfair at times, with enemies constantly knocking you over and casting spells at you.  When it comes to the magic system, I've got to say that you can pull off some of the most cheaty attacks with it.  Let's say you've got a boss weak to earth magic.  During Gnome's animation sequence he'll do his little flip and smash his hammers together.  When they hit is when you can cast the spell again.  If you time it right, the spell will get cast just as the last one ends.  Since bosses can't move during a casting event, you can just keep attacking and casting without the boss ever getting an attack off.  Later on though, using magic almost becomes a requirement, as physically hitting some bosses can be a real pain.  I absolutely loved the weapons upgrade and leveling systems though.  The fact that you have to use a weapon or spell type to level it up was great, and seeing your magic evolve from things like small fireballs to freaking dragons was incredibly satisfying.


Crystalis:
I didn't get to play Crystalis until I was in college.  If you enjoyed it, perhaps try the Ys series.  Particularly the remade ones on steam.  Even more specifically, the remake of 3, called ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"" and ""Ys: Origin""  Both have that isometric adventure style, a similar money system, a good story, and damn good music to boot.  The Ys 1 & 2 remakes are similar, very fun, and challenging, but the combat system is the same as it was with the very first Ys games.",1406774843.0
2c73di,cjcm0vo,1,"the older i get the fonder my memories grow from when i was young; that being said, some of the games from yesteryear may not hold up as well as we might believe.  I played final fantasy vi when it was first released, and that was the game that sparked my interest in rpg's (Ni No Kuni was a masterpiece in my mind).  the story for ffvi was very engaging on a imaginative level, and it wasn't impossible for anyone to complete if they had the will.  i look back at this game as the rpg masterpiece of the 8bit/16bit era. 
secret of mana was a rest stop on the way to the next zelda release for me.  the fact that it was up to 3 players was a definite plus, since most of my time was spent hanging out with friends.  as always the soundtracks were top notch for any square games of that era. i did find the item menus a little clunky, but it flowed nicely and there wasn't a lot to compare it too back then.
i thoroughly enjoyed those games when they were released, but for me those games are very hard to play through a second time, and i would be interested to hear what newer players think about the experience.",1406771578.0
2c73di,cjczmzy,1,"For the older Final Fantasy games, I find it more rewarding to challenge myself by not grinding for gold and experience. Think of the random encounters as the way you prepare for the next boss fight. To make it seem like less of a chore, I learned to coordinate my party's attacks to take out enemies in the fewest possible rounds. 

If you search every area of dungeons and every pot/clock in towns, you will be leveled and equipped just to the point where boss battles (and even some random encounters later on) take some strategy to overcome. I think VI in particular was balanced to the point where you could just grind it out by farming for gold and exp if you wanted an easier time, or charge ahead making full use of the ethers, elixers, and other items you'll never have to use if you're too strong. IV is a little less forgiving.

Anyway, that's my advice if you find the combat tiresome. It'll definitely add some spice to your experience. Another tip for VI that'll come in handy: refuse Banon when he asks Terra to join the Returners 3 times and he'll give you a Genji Glove relic (allows wearer to equip two weapons).",1406815736.0
2c73di,cjd5bei,1,"One thing you can't escape in any of the turn-based FF games is random encounters with repetitive enemies.  When you first enter a new area (or floor of a dungeon), you're likely to face some new enemies, but once you figure out how to beat them, it is an exercise in tedium getting through the rest of the dungeon.  On the positive side, both IV and VI are good with making sure your characters level enough in each area through random encounters so that you will be strong enough to beat the storyline bosses.

Secret of Mana had a good story and occasionally good music, but although Square set out to create Zelda-like gameplay, they failed for the most part.

I never heard of the ys series, so í´m glad you brought that up. Currently checking some reviews, and i´m eyeing the psp version since i happen to own one and im always glad to start this old fucker up :) 

About FF, what  you describe is actually pretty disappointing. Maybe i will just watch a letsplay of it, i have one bookmarked that is 28hours long and fun people playing it. Currently in both games i´m dungeons that are built like fucking maze´s and every few steps i have a fucking battle with the same guys i just mash away....i just cant take it sadly, i wish i had played those games back then :(

Yes i mean seiken densetsu, i just got me a translated rom (yarrr!).

* Describing that broken boss battle doesnt sound promising, are the rest of the encounters with normal enemies and bosses also that broken ?

2c73di,cjcsaiz,1,"  Broken, but still really fun.  Definitely not a big deal, and you don't have to take advantage of the magic bug to win.  I've just played through the game so many times that I'll use it to skip through particular fights.  There's only a couple areas I actually felt frustrated or where things were unfair, but once you learn to work around them, you're fine.  The Wall Face/Doom's Wall battles can be a real pain.  Mostly because you can run out of time and if the one eye triggers its healing too often, you can really be screwed.  Spring Beak/Axe Beak can be tough too, as they move a lot and the hit box for them is weird.  Spikey/Blue Spike are the only ones I'd consider unfair.  I think just about every one of their attacks are unavoidable.  There's a few regular enemies that you can get caught up in a chain of hits from.  I remember Pebblers being the worst, watch out for their bouncing attacks.  The best trick when you get immobilized by an unfair attack is to hit select to change characters so you can continue to attack.  That and keep a few cup of wishes and you'll be fine.

You've definitely got your pick with Ys games.  I think V is the only one that didn't get an English release, and Aeon Genesis has a translation for it now.  There's also an anime series for the first 2 games that is pretty good.  Also, if you haven't tried it yet, you'll definitely want to play Chrono Trigger.  Still my all time favorite RPG.  No random encounters, an amazing, engaging story, multiple endings, many side quests and hidden items.  I've run through it 100% and I'm still not tired of it.  You've got your pick of consoles to play it on too, though I'd opt for one with the anime cutscenes.

That's a shame about the FF series, though.  I really enjoyed the story for IV.  The play style definitely isn't for everyone though.

2c73di,cjdgs11,1,"No, actually the Western releases are just known as the ""Mana"" series.

The Western games in the series aren't identified by the suffixes 2, 3, 4, etc. to denote the order of their release. Other Western releases include Legend of Mana (PS1), Dawn of Mana (PS2), Children of Mana (NDS), Heroes of Mana (NDS), Sword of Mana (GBA), and (oddly enough) Final Fantasy Adventure (GB). As you may have guessed, the original Western release of the first Seiken Densetsu game was localized as Final Fantasy Adventure for the Gameboy, and later remade and localized for the Gameboy Advance as Sword of Mana. Fans sometimes like to refer to Seiken Densetsu 3 as Secret of Mana 2, but it's completely aesthetic and arbitrary, and had the game ever been officially released outside of Japan it would have probably been called *Something-Not-Secret* of Mana (probably *Stories* of Mana or *Rivals* of Mana, considering the overall plot of the game). Like the majority of Final Fantasy games, the Seiken Densetsu series is characterized by a few core gameplay elements and a few general themes, but each game is otherwise completely independent from one another. In other words, none of the characters, events or specific story elements from Secret of Mana are related to those in Seiken Densetsu 3. In Japan however the Seiken Densetsu games do contain the suffixes 2, 3, 4, etc. to denote the order of their release, so when you start talking about ""Secret of Mana 1 & 2"" you're basically talking about their chronological order, which would accurately be 2 & 3 with respect to the SNES releases.

It's also worth noting that sometimes the (excellent) SNES game Secret of Evermore is regard as being a member of the ""Mana"" series. But it wasn't developed by Squaresoft Japan, its overall themes are different, and it was not released in Japan as part of the Seiken Densetsu series. It is, for all intents and purposes, a completely separate game despite its gameplay similarities and its similar-sounding title to Secret of Mana.

\- I play the original jet set radio. never played future but it looks awesome and is a big game suggestion in the jet set radio community!

\- Many people consider the original Resident evil a classic for playstation however it dosnt look too good by todays standards. The gamecube port looks 10x better and keeps most of the core gameplay and elements as opposed to the modern day remasters.

\- if you plan on emulating any of these, then a controller def will makes the experience better! I use a offbrand wired xbox 360 controller but there are also alternatives for a more premium experience. 8bitdo on amazon offers SNES and N64 themed gamepads but the N64 one is a bit costly.

The fact that there was no story mode because of the cutscenes being put online is beyond childish. Sakurai continues to do things like that and their treatment of Melee is awful.

As far as Zelda. Art style is what it is, I think a majority of the people have moved past the more stylistic elements even if they don't like them. I didn't love Wind Waker's look, but the gameplay is still undeniably Zelda. My issue with Breath of The Wild is the frame rate and not the graphical style. You can dislike the look of the series but it's always been more on the lighter cartoonish side. Twilight Princess is more of an outlier in terms of in game art style, even though it is my favorite.

Nintendo at the time had a laundry list of 'taboo topics' that frequently had to be changed.

A good example of this is the game Tales of Eternia (JP). Due to Mattel's 'Masters of the Universe'  (He-Man) IP taking place on a fictional planet called Eternia, this Tales game was instead localized as Tales of Destiny II, even though the story had no real connection to the previous Tales of Destiny I game.

It's just such a great game and I'd just never played it and I don't think even heard of it. Also the graphics are amazing.

Just these three games have sort of rekindled my interest in actually looking at SNES games I'd never played before and were maybe just sort of overlooked by me and seemingly many others. I've always been a big fan of the Contra series, even some of the lesser games in the series, and both of these really scratched my itch I didn't realize I had for very challenging, technical run-and-gun style games.

gtjh3r,fsc8708,-1,"GameCube would be a good thing right now because it is on the verge of prices going way up.  There are already some random games that have done so. 

I'd recommend grabbing stuff like F-Zero GX, P.N. 03, POkeyMans Coloseum, Ribbit King, Super Monkey Ball 2, Star Fox Adventures (don't listen to the internet...it's still fun,) and REmake.  I'm sure others have more suggestions for cheap(er) games that will almost definitely appreciate that are worth playing. 

Sega: honestly, just get the Sega collection for modern systems.  If you want to go beyond that then stuff like Cyborg Justice, X-Men 2 and such.  Anything truly outstanding us going to run you some heavy cash, is on the the Sega CD, is rare as all hell, or most likely all three of the aforementioned. 

PS1 has a TON of good, cheap stuff on it if you don't mind the chunky, shaky polygons. You can get stuff like Sheep, Final Fantasy Tactics, Jumping Flash, and a ton of other stuff for fairly cheap all day long. 

Probably the most value, my opinion, right now to collect for is the original Xbox. A truly massive amount of underrated games going for 5-20$ on the high end and the graphics still hold up on a lot more games than you'd think. It's hard to emulate and there is so much good stuff on there for so cheap that it's criminal...and the prices will go up when people figure out that stuff like GunValkyrie, Crimson Sea, Otogi, Sudeki, and a ton of other stuff actually exists. 

Handheld...you've missed the window for PSP being cheap. Vita is going to be even worse because, my opinion, Vita is the best handheld system ever made. (Especially when you own two and CFW the second.)

Original GameBoy is also very worth looking in to because the supply was usually so high and the market was so saturated...there's just a certain charm to it, too.  Get a modded, modernized original, though.  Spend the money on a good system from a reputable builder and then you can find stuff like Quirk, Motocross Maniacs, etc. for cheap and you'll have countless hours of true handheld joy.",1590866022.0

pgkfzu,hbcocc0,1,"The short answer is to get whatever you like to play. The longer answer is...

...Don't. Just don't.

Get yourself a bunch of emulators and run them on a decent PC. If you're feeling especially hipster, get a [MiSTer](https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html) and a high quality [CRT](https://www.retrorgb.com/rgbmonitors.html).

In this subreddit we can answer questions about a lot of things, but when it comes to *collecting*, the sky is the limit. You wouldn't go into the hoarder subreddit and ask them how many cats is too many because they don't have an answer for that.

Eventually you'll have shelves of expensive but useless crap that will just be taking up space. It ends up being a lot easier to fire up an emulator than to connect the 3DO to your setup, and deep down you *know* that you're never going to unbox your Nuon again just to play [Tempest 3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_3000).

OK so links...

You can go [here](https://www.pricecharting.com/) for prices and cry. Seriously though, look something up and divide it by 3 or 4 to get a reasonable number.

If you're looking to what to prioritize *right now* I would say [seventh generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_generation_of_video_game_consoles) stuff would be about as cheap as they will ever be.  Eighth generation is still popular too as even though the ninth gen systems have been out for a year, they might as well not be.

[BEWARE OF COUNTERFEIT GAMES!](https://kotaku.com/how-to-spot-fake-classic-video-games-1839513923)  There are a lot of games out there that weren't well produced but still worth buying. I have no problem with reproductions, as long as they aren't purporting to be the genuine article. There are some games like the PC Engine Super CD [Sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginga_Fukei_Densetsu_Sapphire) that even if I personally knew the seller and they had a photo of them buying it in 1995 in Akihabara, I still wouldn't buy it.

Go watch the youtube channels [My Life in Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/c/mylifeingaming), [Game Sack](https://www.youtube.com/c/GameSack), and [Metal Jesus Rocks](https://www.youtube.com/c/MetalJesusRocks). They are all avid ~~hoarders~~ collectors. You will learn a lot from them.

Even if you still want to get into collecting, I say find what you like and build from there. Never pay over what you think it's worth and never buy something just to complete your collection unless you happen to be a billionaire.",1630609594.0

Personally I feel like street fighter alpha 2 and super street fighter 2/turbo are more enjoyable on the psx as alpha 2 is more polished in gold edition and super street fighter 2 and turbo editions are combined to offer the best of both combined as super street fighter 2 turbo. Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion. 

For reproductions (should you go that route) /u/wildertronix offers some very reasonable prices. I got terranigma and secret of mana 2 for $30 each.

81hb3r,dv3vtbt,1,"I would definitely pick up any Turbo CD game that interests you. Castlevania Rondo of Blood is by far the most popular, but Ys 1 & 2 and Gate of Thunder are a few more to consider. I would say these games are most unlikely to get current gen ports as while they're not impossible to emulate, they can be tricky to get working. Not to mention licensing is all over the place. 

I do not have my Wii anymore and I know none of lists online are accurate (some games were delisted and game availability varies by region), but the Turbografx games that are also CD games are 800-900 points. I can give better suggestions if I have an updated list and your region.

I'd also recommend picking up Nintendo 64 games (as you seem to be interested in) as Nintendo's internal emulator on Wii is really good. I like how Star Fox 64 and Super Smash Bros play with a GameCube controller more than elsewhere, so I can easily recommend those. Pokemon Snap also lets you save pictures to an SD Card, which is awesome if you're into Pokemon. But seriously, I'd dump your Virtual Console money solely on Nintendo 64 and Turbo CD games. I picked up most of the Nintendo 64 games back when they came out, but regret not buying more Turbo CD games.

And remember that anything else has a good chance of being re-released on the Switch, like the Super Nintendo games you mentioned. I'd hold off on those unless you really need to play them in the next 3-6 months. But if you've already waited 25 years to check them out, what's another few months?

So, real organ music, different sound effects, and a FMV intro montage are what puts it over the top?  That doesn't make sense.  But it's neat list.  ",1538684601.0

Often times the issue with is with the expansion pak slot, try opening that and pulling out the pak and cleaning the pins.
Like this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnATXwuU8NA

It's possibly corrosion on some of the pins, and you can try cleaning both the cartridge slot and the cart with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol.

If that all fails I'd just carefully open it up and see if you see any obvious corrosion or leaking capacitors on the motherboard.

I guarantee you it is repairable.",1658554257.0
w5oypu,ihah95m,3,"Even systems that have been flooded can usually be taken apart and throughly cleaned/ washed and work like new.  The most important thing with wet electronics is to not turn them on while they're still wet - this can easily fry them, so you'd want to allow them to fully dry.

Honestly though, if left in a damp environment, corrosion on the pins that facilitate electronic connections can cause poor connection.  If the video out port from the N64 isn't getting good connection, you won't get a picture.  Also, if the cartridges/cartridge ports can't reach a connection, nothing will display on the screen.  I've bought several systems and cartridges that people thought were garbage, but a 2 minute cleaning process brought them right back to life.  The quick and dirty method for cartridge cleaning is just to insert/pull out/reinsert the cart into the game system about 20 times.  It literally scrapes enough corrosion and residue off of the pins to see if the game is good or not.

d1fhfd,ezovaux,1,"I think you may have found some way to fit 35 questions into one post and I’m legitimately impressed.

To try to answer them:

• Everything Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4 you should be able to find at GameStop and contrary to what you have said it seems as though I can’t go into a store without seeing them. I mean if you’re even super desperate there’s always Walmart. 

•GameStop has Wii games. DS games as well.

• it would help if you told us what general area you live in (like what country and if you live in the US, what state) that way people can give you more local recommendations of the best stores to go to for each thing.

• Facebook marketplace is a good way to find local people selling used games/systems and is usually reasonably priced

• to aid your eBay concerns, set up saved searches and alerts for those searches, be willing to look at auctions and not just buy it now, and be sure to sort by price and watch certain items you like. Also don’t be afraid to look at bigger lots if you have the money. And foreign languages and pirated, while they definitely exist on eBay, can very easily be avoided by making sure you read descriptions on items before you buy them, make sure you read seller reviews and don’t buy from foreign countries unless you’re specifically buying something that didn’t come out in your country.

• GameCube and Gameboy advance, Xbox OG, PS2 all on eBay and Facebook marketplace or online on GameStop.
 
• I’ve surprisingly found a lot of used PS1’s on FB marketplace and Goodwill. They’re really not hard to find but that’s where I’d start. You can also buy them used on GameStop’s website. And worst comes to worst there are plenty of eBay lots.

•Definitely recommend SNES, NES, Genesis, and PS1 minis if you just want to play the games easily on a modern TV for a reasonable price

• Mario Baseball, Sunshine, and Wind Waker are by no means hard to find, they are slightly more expensive than most GameCube games. But eBay and GameStop and FB are your friend. Again, set up eBay alerts for these specific games.

• [Ratchet and Clank PS2](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F163853906957), there are several variants but none of them seem very hard to find

• Pokémon GBA games are also not hard to find but are expensive. Educate yourself on how to spot fakes because there are a lot of fakes for those games you mentioned. I would recommend buying Pokémon games in person so you can inspect them thoroughly before you buy. 

•Every game you listed after the Pokémon games please just set up eBay alerts for. Thank you for educating me that there is a GTA advance game, I will be buying that.

• In respect to the online services for PS3 being shut down, I haven’t played those specific games but if they’re online only then it would not make sense to buy them as you wouldn’t be able to play them. If they aren’t online only, then get them if they’re something you want to play.

• [Little Big Planet PS3](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F174024448053) 

• [Forza Motorsport 2 Xbox 360](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F323907103083)

If I were to ballpark it, probably **100** or so surviving would be a reasonable estimate.  
  
Another cartridge in that category is [TI-99 Dragon's Lair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYcl0ozAjiE&t=16m40s).  
  
About **150** of those were made, almost all of which can be presumed to survive.

I also felt that they just spread more misinformation around with their explanation of bits. It's all more complex than they made it out to be.

The SEGA genesis could be though of as being 8,9,16,24, and 32 bits all at the same time, depending on how you look at it.

It has an 8 bit Z80 co-processor with 16 bit addressing, the sound chips are both on an 8-but bus, the color palette is 9-bits per pixel, the main 68k CPU is uses 16-bit instructions with a 16-bit bus, 24-bit addressing, and 32-bit arithmetic and registers.

7orncg,dsbs9mo,2,"If you want to play the game the way the developers intended you want to avoid ones that *were* PAL optimized, unless of course you insist on playing them in 50hz. I have a lot of unoptimized PAL games that I play on NTSC or modded systems in 60hz.

Anyway, to answer your question, the only way you can know for sure is to compare the NTSC and PAL versions directly running them on the same system/emulator settings.

Keep in mind that quite often only *some* things were optimized. In the case of NES, many games only had the music optimized (in most later consoles, the music timing is independent of the video frequency - Sonic 1 is actually a rare exception), but even when the gameplay was optimized it's likely only some things like the main character's speed was adjusted, while enemies or projectiles still move slower. Optimizing a game for PAL speeds isn't just a magical variable adjustment, unfortunately.",1515347666.0
7orncg,dsfo8wd,1,"Nah, I don't mind playing at 50hz. I do have a preference to 60hz (because it never suffers poorly optimised games), but 60hz modes in games is the Dreamcast onwards, and importing is expensive and time consuming. I don't mind whether it is 50hz or 60hz, though given the choice I will always choose 60hz, even if the 50hz is optimised. I don't see why I should avoid fully optimised games though (unless a certain aspect isn't optimised, but then that's not fully optimised)

I have been exploring the viability of running PAL games on an NTSC console and seems to be viable for the Master System, Mega Drive and Saturn (though I'll still be cursed by the terrible PAL cases). Games that have numerous regions contained on one cartridge like (Streets of Rage 2)[https://segaretro.org/Streets_of_Rage_2#Versions] would be really good

The games I do need to watch out for are:

Part optimised games as the certain optimised aspect will/may run too fast. Although with optimised music, things are more mixed, with some games running the music at the right speed and others running too fast

Games that have any factor sped up only slightly (but not up to the full/correct) as they won't run right in either 50hz or 60hz

Games that suffer glitches when played at 60hz (like Sonic 3. Also Sonic 3 is not optimised)


Back on topic, I was watching Mario Kart 64 on a YouTube longplay and it definatly seems to be running fast than I remember; the longplay got to the first hill on Luigi Raceway faster. So I'll have to do more comparisons like that to see whether or not games are optimised. I still need to compare Truxton on the Mega Drive at 50hz and 60hz to the arcade version to see whether or not the rumours of Truxton running at the right speed at 50hz are true or not

Isn't only adjusting one aspect of gameplay speed the nasty thing Nintendo used to do on the NES and SNES. Apparently, Crash Bandicoot on the PS1, most of the game seems to be optimised, but the bosses seems to run slow.",1515531905.0
7orncg,dsfq4t3,2,"Even though some jobs are better than others, I think it's very rare to find a game that is truly ""fully"" optimized. Nintendo were actually among the better companies to do it, I think Super Mario Bros. 3 seems to appear very well optimized. But since the music is timed to the vblank on NES, it was very common for NES games to have the music optimized but not the gameplay at all (Konami and Capcom were both very ""consistent"" with that, meanwhile their 16 bit games are just plain unoptimized).

Here's a rough list of NES PAL titles, and what aspects of them were changed for the PAL version. If both fields check as ""60hz"", they play just like US/Jap copies, and should run fine on a region free NTSC system:

9rm9ju,e8ini37,4,"If you still have any of your old PS2 games, I say go with a PS2.

If you want to get something different, go with the Dreamcast. SEGA's love note to both it's fans and true gamers alike.

It had it's arcade ports, but it also had some spectacular RPG's and shmups on it.

It's one of those consoles you really have to play on to really enjoy it. Crazy Taxi is absolutely fun and there best arcade port besides Daytona USA 2001. 

SoulCalibur, one of the best fighters on the console and an early release game that showed to the world how powerful the Dreamcast really was in it's time.

If you want a really fun and addictive sports game, Virtua tennis and Virtua tennis 2 are worth playing. I would never have thought I would play a sports game willingly, let alone a tennis game. But this is one title that is a must have in any Dreamcast collection. The gameplay is fun and really addictive.

You got the first 2 modern Sonic games being Sonic Adventure 1&2, the best ones in the entire modern Sonic line of games besides Sonic Advance games and Colours. And I recommend playing the original Dreamcast Version of Sonic Adventure over the later directors cut. Unless you get the PC version and mod it.

You also got Sega's own RPG's on it consisting of Shenmue, Skies of Arcadia, and Phantasy Star Online.

Shenmue like SoulCalibur is a really beautiful game. But besides how beautiful the graphics are, it is very well thought out with everything. Your actually in the world of Japan in the 1980's living day to day. It is probably the most detailed rpg you will ever play.

Skies of Arcadia is fantastic. One of my most favorite JRPG's on the system. Yeah it was ported to the gamecube with extra content. But is that extra content worth lower quality audio compared to the higher audio quality of the Dreamcast? And the game has some great music in it so I would go with this version.

Phantasy Star Online.... Technically the original servers are down. HOWEVER!!! Thanks to some ingenious people working with a raspberry pi, they have brought back the online capabilities of the Dreamcast and now you can play Phantasy Star Online with friends on a private server. And even download DLC for games that support it like Sonic Adventure.

There are other games supported like Quake III arena as well opening up more possibilities.

House of the Dead is a really fun flagship on rails light gun series Sega has developed, and it is extremely fun. But if you don't own a CRT at all, or light guns, no worries! Get a Dreamcast keyboard and you can instead play ""Typing of the dead!"" It basically is House of the Dead 1 and replaces the light gun system for a keyboard system, characters in game are modified to carry around a backpack/keyboard system.

And you type out words and phrases to shoot and kill zombies. Probably the most interesting games to teach you how to type.

Funny enough it is also a console who's library is never actually ending. People are still making brand new unlicensed games for the system to this day. It is a console that has never actually died.

Now hook ups to a modern tv can be a bit of a pain with the Dreamcast. If you don't have a CRT, and your modern TV doesn't support VGA, then a dreamcast VGA box is next to useless to you. Might be better to look into a Akura Dreamcast HDMI box by the behar Bros if you want the best quality possible from the Dreamcast.

Though be warned, some games will not play even with the Akura. They need a composite/S-Video connection to play. This is why I own an older Dreamcast VGA box. I got it connected to my CRT and my modern LCD TV. Since it supports VGA.

Some other things to take note as well. The Dreamcast will let out a loud grinding noise from the disc drive when it is loading from the disc. Before you get worried and think something is maJorly wrong... DON'T PANIC! This is normal! It is an annoying side effect due to the gd-roms design. You will get over it after awhile.

Also to note, when you get used VMU's, plan on replacing the old 2032 batteries in them they will most likely be dead. And keep a bunch around if you tend to use your VMU like a tamagatchi with Sonic Adventure and the Chao. Or play mini games that add extra items and money in games like Skies of Arcadia.

The batteries really only last in the VMU's for two weeks from my own tests.

Believe me, if you get a Dreamcast, you will fall in love with it. It is an amazing console. I learned that after making the mistake of selling my first one years ago. After getting a second one and retrobrighting it, I will never, ever, ever make the same mistake again.

9rm9ju,e8ii1c7,2,"Man, this is a tough call and it's subjective, even with your requests.

Based off of what you've said, though, I'd recommend either a fat PS2 since it's backwards compatible withe PS1 or a SNES.  Here are my reasons.

PS2: Again, backwards compatible with PS1 as well and if you are an RPGer, the PS1 was THE RPG system.  The PS1 & PS2 both also had a bunch of solid games for practically every genre, including platforms, racers, first-person shooters and adventure style games.

SNES: If you're really into RPGs and want to experience the ""golden"", 2D era, then the SNES is your only choice.  There's almost too many RPGs to count that are of excellent calibre and, of course, you're going to have your fill of Zelda and Mario games.  You also can't beat the Donkey Kong trilogy and there's also an excellent lot of space shooters too.

Ultimately, it's tough to say what's right for you.  As an aside, I grew up with all of the systems you mentioned and many others.  I love RPGs, a good Mario game and I also like arcade racers from time to time.  If I had to lock myself into one system, it'd be the PS1 but, again, you get a PS1 with a PS2 so that gives you thousands of excellent games to choose from between the two.",1540589117.0

> Crazy Taxi is absolutely fun and there best arcade port besides Daytona USA 2001. 

_Daytona USA 2001_ is more of its own thing than an arcade port, and I'd go as far as saying that _Daytona USA_ didn't get a home console version that did the arcade original justice until the Xbox 360 version.

The Dreamcast shared hardware with the Naomi arcade system so there are a lot of Dreamcast games that are virtually pixel-perfect arcade ports (_Crazy Taxi_, _The House of the Dead 2_, _Dead or Alive 2_, _Power Stone_, _Virtua Tennis_, _Marvel vs. Capcom 2_, _Confidential Mission_ etc) - if you love consoles that bring the arcade experience home then the Dreamcast is a great choice. The official arcade sticks for it are excellent, too!

> Get a Dreamcast keyboard and you can instead play ""Typing of the dead!"" It basically is House of the Dead 1 and replaces the light gun system for a keyboard system, characters in game are modified to carry around a backpack/keyboard system.

It's based on _The House of the Dead 2_ - I point this out as I'm a bit sad that there will likely never be a good home console port of the original _The House of the Dead_ as SEGA have lost the source code and the existing Saturn version is extremely rough around the edges.",1540611547.0

Personally I feel like street fighter alpha 2 and super street fighter 2/turbo are more enjoyable on the psx as alpha 2 is more polished in gold edition and super street fighter 2 and turbo editions are combined to offer the best of both combined as super street fighter 2 turbo. Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion. 

For reproductions (should you go that route) /u/wildertronix offers some very reasonable prices. I got terranigma and secret of mana 2 for $30 each.

I FINALLY bought Baten Kaitos Origins not long ago and now there is a remaster coming... same thing with A Wonderful Life.) and sometimes I do it just because I like the original vision of a game more. Ai upscaling, emulation-like smoothing filters etc always feel... cheap to me. They destroy the original artwork more often than not or leave distracting artifacts in the artwork. Or destroy the consistency of the Art, like the Persona 3 Portable Remaster. Or there is some other downside, like 30 fps on the Tales of Symphonia Remaster. Why buy that if my original game just plays better?

If a remaster is actually good or features a game I reeeeaaaally love I will pick it up. The Suikoden Remaster actually looks amazing and kinda does the Metroid Prime Remaster. ToS on the other hand just looks like the game I already own but worse, so no thanks.

* **Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (SNES)** - odd one, being a licensed game, but it's great beat'em up. Really fun and has an amazing soundtrack by Iku Mizutani, I love his music. I rented this a lot in the 90s, eventually bought it, and even today play it once or twice a year still via emulation.

* **Mega Man X series** - Mostly X1, X2, and X4. Also X5 to some degree. I owned X1 in the 90s, and X5 in the early 2000s. Rented the other SNES games, and only played X4 the first time in 2014 or so. Love this series. Odd, since I'm not a big fan of the NES games.

* **Mega Man Zero 1-4 (GBA)** - Love these even more than the X series. Zero's a badass. Only played these for the first time in 2012 or 2013.

* **The Death and Return of Superman (SNES)** - Another beat'em up and a guilty pleasure. It's an objectively bad Superman game, but an okay beat'em up, were anyone else the protagonist. I bought it back in the 90s because I was obsessed with Supes.

* **TMNT - Turtles in Time (SNES)** - Owned this one from release I think. Like with Superman, I was a *huuuuuuge* TMNT fan. Still am. I even liked the Michael Bay movies. Don't hurt me (and go watch *TMNT Forever*, it's awesome). Hyperstone Heist is pretty good too.

* **TMNT (NES)** - yes, the infamous one. It's great, I don't care what anyone says. Still haven't beaten it.

* **Xenogears(PS1)** - I got this in high school. Buddy of mine sold it to me for $10 not long after release as a birthday gift. Sounds odd, but it was retailing for $50-60 and we were broke asses, so it was still a gift to me. I still have those discs. And I think everyone should play this game. It's amazing.

* **FF Tactics** - I love this game, but never play it. I've beaten it twice. Owned it around the same time I got Xenogears. Just an amazing game, but it's hard to find time for long in-depth strategy RPGs as a grown-ass man with a job and responsibilities and shit.

* **Final Fantasy 7 (PS1)** - Got this in 1999 or 2000. Loved it. Still love it. Played it again in 2015/2016 with the Beacause translation and loved it again. As a teen, I shipped Cloud and Aerith like everyone else, but as a married adult I can really appreciate the subtly of the bond and the love between Cloud and Tifa. That was truly love, and even today it chokes me up a bit. Even more so than the disc 1 spoiler. I like to pretend Advent Children and other related items don't exist.

* **Final Fantasy (NES)** - The original, and the game that introduced me to JRPGs all the way back in the late 80s. It's still great today, and there's so many remakes that there's something for everyone.

* **Final Fantasy 4 (SNES)** - Back when it was still called FF2, yo. Never owned this as a kid (until I got a GBA in my late teens/early 20s). But I love this game. There's something charming about it, despite being less complex than FF6, 7, or some others. The straight up good versus evil battle, Cecil's journey from darkness into light, the love interest in Rosa, Tellah's need for revenge and later acceptance... Edward, Palom and Porom... just the entire cast stands out and somehow I'm feeling emotional just typing about it, so it had an impact on me. I love this game.

* **Cyborg Justice (Sega Genesis)** - Played this the first time back in '98 or '99. A clunky beat'em up with some awesome combat mechanics. It's not everyone's cup of tea and I once hated it. But over the years I've been repeatedly drawn to it and have grown to love it. Pretty sure I can beat this one without using continues now, I've played that much of it in recent past.

* **Vagrant Story (PS1)** - Got this on late 2000/early 2001. I love JRPGs and in the PS1 era Squaresoft could do no wrong. This game was no exception. It's amazing. I replayed it back in 2015 or 2016 and it's as good as I remember.

* **Mighty Final Fight (NES)** - I dislike the Final Fight series for the most part. But Mighty Final Fight is *amazing*. It's way fast paced compared to its ""bigger"" brethren and so fun to play. Only played it for the first time when I tested it out and chose it for game of the month back in mid-2016.

* **River City Ransom** - this one's new to me as of last month, but it's fantastic. It's kind of been on the fringes of my perception for a long time, and I was passingly familiar with the Kunio-kun series but I'd never played it. Recently was listening to Random (Mega Ran) again and came across this group track he was on with Phillip Morris and some other folks called *[River City Handsome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMEgkkxNfGA)* and I couldn't resist any longer; I had to play it. It's just way ahead of its time for a NES game.

There's way more where that came from and this doesn't even get into my love for some of the GBA library, or other newer stuff like NDS and PS2, but this is already too long and those aren't considered retro here (though I consider them retro now).",1503866586.0
6waw25,dm6vj3t,2,"Chrono Trigger on SNES! My all time favorite. First played it as a kid in the late 90s, but didn't fully appreciate its complexities.",1503839556.0
6waw25,dm86o8p,2,"I started playing video games back in 1993. My first gaming experience was with a very simplistic PC game whose name I can't remember, let alone if it was licensed or not. Around that time I also had a chance to play with an Atari 2600 at a much older neighbor's house. Then, in 1994, we got our first PC and at that point I started really getting into gaming. I remember that I had one of my older siblings over to install a bunch of stuff on our machine and among the various, useless, software he installed I also got 3 games: Prehistorik 2, Doom and some game that I never actually quite got to work.

Since I was weaned on gaming in the 90s I suppose that it's not much of a surprise to tell you that my entire top 10 ""Greatest games of all times"" is made up entirely of games made before 2001. On top of that, since I didn't have my first console until 1997, it's mostly PC games. 

Anyway, without further ado here's my top 3 favorite games of all time:

Half-Life -- (first played 1999)

Now-a-days Half-Life might not stand up to the test of time, but when it first came out it was mind blowing. Much like other games that came out in the 90s Half-Life didn't have an ""in your face"" narrative or dialog trees, but what it did with its minimalist approach to story telling was basically what shaped the entire FPS genre and molded it into what it is today. On top of that the gameplay was equally as fantastic, with various levels, brilliant (for the time) enemy AI and a fantastic multiplayer. I must’ve played through Half-Life at least 10 times and I never once got bored of it. Hell, I even find the train ride at the beginning of the game interesting, even now. Another reason why HL is my favorite game of all time is because the multiplayer was out of this world. Even before Counter-Strike came out Half-Life’s multiplayer had a special appeal. Back then all shooters were Quake clones, so when you had a game like Half-Life, where you didn’t bunny-jump from platform to platform and blasted foes in the face with a rocket launcher it was mind bending. You had to use strategy, listen for footsteps, stalk your pray with the crossbow, decide whether to make a run for the first aid station or stay low. It really was something else back then.

Heroes of Might and Magic 3 -- (first played 1999)

HOMM3 is not a very controversial or divisive game. I have yet to meet someone who has played this game and not liked it. HOMM3 was such a niche game that people basically either got right into it or didn't buy it at all. For me it holds a special place due to all the memories associated with this game. I used to be a major HOMM2 player and played it obsessively with friends but HOMM3 would not work on my aging PC. I remember having a magazine with a review of the game that I basically read into oblivion until I could finally find a way to play it, which was usually at friend's places or in internet cafes. It's one of those quintessentially 90s moments, when you didn't have the internet to look at hours upon hours of gameplay, and when games that didn't meet the minimum spec simply didn't work (scaling was not a thing back then) that would never happen in today's world.

Baldur's Gate -- (first played 2000/2001)

The odd one out from the list, I guess, because most people would probably pick Baldur's Gate 2 over the original. However, back when I first played this, the game was simply breathtaking. The amount of choice BG gave players was insane, you could customize your main character any way you wanted, you could go in any direction you wanted starting from the second area of the game, you could basically do anything you wanted; the game gave you all it's toys and sent you on your merry way. Sure, you had games like Daggerfall that were also huge, but back in 1999 Bioware set a standard for this sort of game with its brilliant gameplay, great side characters, detailed conversation trees and player choice.

I could go on and on about these games and other games that came out in the 90s. I loved Chrono Trigger and it's my favorite console game of all time. I was obsessed, at one point, with Resident Evil and its many sequels; when I got an NES I remember playing the **** 
out of the original Contra until I beat it multiple times (solo and co-op) with just the original 3 lives; I remember a demo of Gran Turismo on the PS1 and how I played those 2 damned stages that were included with it until I knew every turn and so on and so forth.

Even though I've played and liked many games that came out since 2000 I never quite found anything to fit into my top 10. And the reason why that is is because gaming took so many leaps in the 90s and early 2000s that comparing the experience of getting a new game back then with getting a new game today is completely unfeasible. If you get a game today chances are that it will be pretty similar to what you could get a year or two ago. But 15-20 years ago buying a new game or a sequel to a game you played 1-2 years prior would be a mind blowing experience. You could go from simple 2D to fully 3D rendered environments. You had games that were originally set in a town or dungeon and then the sequel expanded it to a ENTIRE new world. Those kind of leaps are just not happening any more.",1503908481.0

First played it 2014. It was my first snes game I've played all the way through (I was *just* a little too young during the snes generation). I was blown away by the way narrative was constructed with such simplicity and elegance. It was more about constructing story based on the environment and your interactions with it rather than explicit exposition. I can't think of any other game that does that, at least as well as Super Metroid. Also, the level design was really impressive to me. Very emersive.",1503852041.0

If I had cheated and included an entire series in my list, yeah, the entire bunch of the classic *Castlevania* games would have been there. They're all great, even if I think *III* is superlative. They IGA-vanias, I'm ... less fond of these days. I replayed *Ecclessia* on a fresh level-1 hard mode last year, and even that left me wanting. I don't think I'm a fan of their design, or avatar-based progression in general.

I'm also right there with you in that the *Zero* games may be the best run of *Mega-Man* titles. Though I'm not totally sure, because there are stand-out games all over that series.

558oce,d88o03w,9,"> he says it's Wii emulation, not Wii U !

He has no idea what it is, he's just saying that it seems more similar to the Wii emulation than the Wii U. It doesn't make any sense that it'd be Wii hardware, since Nintendo hasn't manufactured the Wii in years, and the Wii drew far more power than could be supplied over USB.

More likely they're using something based on the 2DS/3DS SoC, since that's already got the mobile-class power draw they need, already has economies of scale from existing production, and already has working NES emulation via the 3DS virtual console.

If not the 2DS/3DS, then it's likely some nearly off-the-shelf ARM SoC, because I really doubt Nintendo would spin a custom part for this.",1475262476.0

aat16l,ecv1llr,13,"Emulation really gets a bad rap. It's amazing and it should be the focus of more companies and preservation societies. Hardware mods and ASIC/FPGA implementations are good to preserve hardware, but for software, open source, platform agnostic emulation provides overwhelming advantages long term with performance on par with any otherimplementation.

Many gamers seem to emulate a bit with a Pi or laptop and decide the lag, accuracy, and performance are not up to snuff. 

If you invest into emulation it can be incredibly rewarding. Want to play all your games on your PVM or CRT in the highest quality? Emulation can do it. Want original controllers? There are fantastic >10ms lag adapters out there. Want to scale up your games perfectly on an OLED? Emulation gives pure digital video and audio for all consoles if desired. Want to increase rendering resolution or improve performance? Use an emulator. 

It's true that emulation isn't perfect, and some consoles (Xbox, Saturn, many obscure sytems) have big issues with lag, accuracy, or glitches. However, emulation for the most common systems made before 2000 is incredible and provides an accessible option for everyone from a casual gamer to a hardcore retro vet. ",1546160272.0
aat16l,ecw4hj4,5,"Preach, brother.

People spend hundreds (thousands?) trying to get their console hardware to look like it would on an emulator.  if they'd just get off their power trip nostalgia high horse and use a damn laptop and plug into an HDTV it'd be damn near the same experience as their completely non practical CRT + modded NES + OSSC + framemeister setup.  I remember seeing some kind of test that showed that emulators these days on modern TVs introduce less or extremely minimal difference in lag from the hardware to a CRT.  

Back then we just played NES and 16 bit consoles on whatever TV our parents or friends had at their house.  Nobody cared and it always played like it.should.  nobody adjusted the geometry or cared about what cables we were using.  It was about the games.  



",1546198961.0
aat16l,ecyczvl,4,"Emulation has allowed me to store or display my actual carts and consoles and kinda preserve them.  There is just too many bonuses on why it can improve retro gaming experiences:

* **Declutter living room.**  I have a wife and kids and with all the modern consoles hooked up, it can be a pain finding switchers and things to get all the old consoles hooked up.   Android TV box does all our multimedia needs like Youtube, Netflix, amazon prime, and retro games.
* **Huge living room**.  I need wireless everything (yes even with the bit of lag it causes).  Corded controllers in the hands of my kids would yank the consoles off of their shelf and smash on the floor
* **NES games with Turbo buttons**.  You can assign Turbo versions of the buttons to an SNES like controller easier.  Making a lot more NES games more fun not trying to tap the button.  It's like having an NES advantage.
* **Nice Interface**.  One of the reasons I love the NES and SNES classic consoles is the experience.  There are a lot of good front end interfaces
* **Save states**.  I don't save scum, but the option is there.  A better use of save states is when I want to put a game down and save when I couldn't save.  Then resume the game a different day.  The equivalent of ""leaving your NES on all day while at school"" but without wasting power and engergy
* **Speed up** \- Being able to speed a game up is really great for games where you grind.  Mostly RPGS, but I've enjoyed it.
* **Cloud saves**.  Yep, I save my progress to the cloud in case something happens.  A simple Google drive or drop box can do the trick.  I even have multiple device I play on and it's easy to sync the save data between them with cloud storage.  I would play Crono trigger on my TV at home, then continue playing at work (on break) on my phone, then continue playing back on the TV when I got home.

Most will say input lag is the big issue, but I'm finding it less an issue, and there is even corded options as well.  Most of it is from the TV so make sure you get a good TV with game mode that can reduce input lag.  Without save states I beat a lot of hard games on emulation so it can be done.  Ninja Gaiden 1,2,3 Megaman 1, Ghost n Goblins, Super ghouls n Ghosts, Castlevania 1,2,3 Gun.Smoke and Ninja Turtles (Konami version).",1546276005.0
aat16l,ecvpsvd,2,"While having to deal with failing hardware is annoying, PCs have their issues too. Even emulation for something as old as Genesis games has been a mixed bag for me, with some playing fine while others have game-breaking bugs that make it impossible to continue. I wouldn't quit on original hardware just because a Goodwill CRT or Famicom broke. Eventually, your PC will too.",1546187803.0

aat16l,ecuvlcr,1,"I went in the opposite direction. Started emulating around 1999-2000 because it was tough to get time on the real hardware, between brother+sister gaming and tv shows. That tendency strengthened during college. Then when I got out, I craved the feel of the actual consoles again. I've got a lot more now than what I grew up with, and have a CRT down in the garage, composite-only, because that's actually better than what I grew up with (RF all the way! :-P )

I'm not looking for the *best* image, just one with the soft tones I grew up with, without being distractingly bad. The LCD TV is good enough for most of that, except games where progressive scan was used for visual effects (Mario Kart SNES) or the horizontal refresh frequency triggers the light gun (Duck Hunt, etc).

And anyhow, I don't have a PC that will reliably emulate GC+Wii, or even every N64 game in my library...or a PC that I'm in a position to hook up to a large enough display.",1546151643.0

I never had a ps1 but I played a ton through emulation and felt like the 3D games looked way better than they did on the real hardware with the texture filtering and higher resolution.

aat16l,ed19fwz,3,"Well I got the strongest hardware available and one that I've proved super happy with.  The **Nvidia Shield TV**.  

Obviously the retro games works flawlessly on the Shield from Atari -> PSP.  Starting with Gamecube it's not 100% perfect so I just play my gamecube games on my Wii (not emulated).  I tested some out, and some play pretty close, but there is always dropped frames or scratchy audio which is enough for me to ruin my gameplay experience, especially since I have the games and an easy way to play them right now.

&#x200B;

The shield also has a window into a lot of good steam ports.  These are Native android games that I've enjoyed a lot and are sometimes on steam or switch/consoles.  Heres' a list of my awesome games I play using just this one device.

* Retro games (NES, SNES, PS1, N64, Gameboy, GBA, MAME, N64, PSP, Atari) 
* JuJu - 2 player co-op feels like donkey kong country.  I think this was an xbox 360 game.
* Mickey's Castle of Illusion (The 3D remake, i think it was PS3)
* Tomb Raider (2012 I think remake? )
* The Witness ( One of my favorite Indie games in the last 5 years)
* Ultimate Chicken Horse  ( I've been enjoying this for some time before people discovered it on Switch).
* Portal  (Classic game that's amazing)
* Chariot  (2-player co-op)
* Trine 2 (3 player co-op)
* Legend of the Skyfish ( zeldish puzzle like game.  For $1 it was great)
* Myst   ( One of my favorite games as a kid, always go back to this. Also can't wait until my kids get a bit older)
* Stikbold!    ( Switch/Steam co-op campaign)
* Contrast .  ( 3D Platformer with lighting that was intersting)
* Q.U.B.E   (Portal-like puzzler.)
* Half Life 2
* Talos Principal
* Evoland - 3 hour adventure that was kind of a proof of concept
* Evoland 2 - A much more filled out game.
* Mercenary Kings - 4 Player split co-op (even online co-op).
* Thimbleweed Park
* Borderlands 2
* Elliot's Quest
* Shovel Knight
* Jack Party Packs

&#x200B;

The shield is also got some features I liked.  I got a couple of the original model, back when it had a micro SD card.  A 256GB card was enough for me to install all these games plus retro games.  The controller uses some faster wifi tech (i'm told) and does feel a bit better when playing harder games like Ninja Gaiden.  Though I can get by with 3rd party bluetooth ones as well.  I think there is a slight performance increase in the shield controllers.  But my hand hurts after a while, even for RPGS like Secret of Evermore.  The Streaming is fast and the UI is snappy.  Netflix, amazon prime plays all the kids shows we need.  

&#x200B;

My TV is a 55 Inch 4K Vizio with 17 ms input lag (advertised) for one of the HDMI ports when in game mode.  This is the port I hook my Shield TV in and make sure i'm in game mode and the play feels good enough for me.

Personally I feel like street fighter alpha 2 and super street fighter 2/turbo are more enjoyable on the psx as alpha 2 is more polished in gold edition and super street fighter 2 and turbo editions are combined to offer the best of both combined as super street fighter 2 turbo. Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion. 

For reproductions (should you go that route) /u/wildertronix offers some very reasonable prices. I got terranigma and secret of mana 2 for $30 each.

Replacing the cartridge shell, I've never had a need for that because usually a bit of cleaning is enough to make it look good. for my experience, reproduction labels, cartridge shells, console shells, anything aftermarket relating to these old consoles will be significantly lower quality than the original stuff.

as for internal hardware/software modifications, I think many of those can be worth doing. To me a hacked wii  is not any less authentic then a stock wii, it just adds way more functionality.

Back in the day I used to buy new systems, leveraging its acquisitions  by selling the old ones and i do not regret it at all, i used the tools I had at hand and was very successful with it. Last year I’ve sold my first NES which was the only I’ve kept on the original box, and I do not regret it, someone else will give it a more proper usage instead, someone will revive a system which was more of a piece of furniture not being used for its original purpose anymore and that’s what really made me sad. So I’ve redirected my attentions to emulation and stop being stuck in the past. Old hardware will not become new neither will bring any new experience to original owners, besides working as a time capsule, which brings zero benefits, however situation may be different for younger generations of collectors, which may end up giving it a more proper usage and care.

As someone who has been a gamer since the days of Atari, who has collected and modded most every modern console available, I accept your challenge in proving me wrong. (This is meant to be a friendly challenge 🙂)

Try playing your PS1 Digital with its dithering in full effect on Silent Hill or MGS, and then compare it against composite output upscaled by a Retrotink 5X or attached to a CRT. One will look better than the other but I'll let you decide which. https://youtu.be/ilsXDNaK0QY Even if you always like razor sharp pixels using RGB Scart upscaled via Retrotink 5X with the right scanlines is arguably a more improved experience. Perhaps if you output 480p -> dac -> RT5X that would be a cleaner signal.

Are other early 3D consoles like a N64 worth digital out modding? Maybe. I think HQ svideo is just about as good as an RGB mod, which is just about as good as a digital out. https://youtu.be/aAfTa8-t7zs

9v36vg,e99617a,2,"You've got a couple weird skips in series. Like Mario Land 1+3, but not 2, and not continuing into the excellent WarioLand 2+3. Or DKC 2+3, but skipping #1. And the God of War games...they're all great stuff.

On N64, you've got Snap, but neither of the Stadium games; seems like you're interested in Pokemon, and the first one at least is pretty cheap, so those seem like weird omissions. With the transfer pack, it'd let you play your Pokemon games on the big screen, too!

SNES and Gamecube both have excellent installments of Metroid ;-) Plus, Super Game Boy (SNES) and Game Boy Player (Game Cube) would let you play your GB games on the TV too; it's convenient sometimes.

Looking at PS2, Ico is a nice companion to Shadow of the Colossus. Okami seems like it would fit in with your other game selections too. And Katamari Damacy is a ton of fun.

edit: No GBA games listed...but there are all the Mario Advance games, Mario Kart, the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games are actually excellent, Advance Wars, Mario+Luigi Superstar Saga is a good RPG, there are some good Kirby games, and like...dozens more bits of awesomeness on that system.",1541628353.0
9v36vg,e9968s3,1,"An interesting list of games! I do have a few additions to suggest that you add to the following systems.  
 

**o Original SNES**

o Super Metroid   
o Kirby super star ultra  
o Megaman X   
o Super Mario RPG  
o Kirbies dream course

**o N64** 

o Legend of zelda: ocarina of time  
o Legend of zelda: majora's mask  
o Conkers bad fur day  
o Super smash bros  
o Goldeneye

**o** **GameCube** 

o Resident evil  
o Metroid Prime  
o paper mario: thousand year door

**o PlayStation 1**   
o Tomb raider  
o Tekken 3  
o Metal gear solid

**o Original Xbox**  
o jet set radio future   


Some additonal notes

\- some of these games such as metal gear solid are my personal favorites

\- I play the original jet set radio. never played future but it looks awesome and is a big game suggestion in the jet set radio community!

\- Many people consider the original Resident evil a classic for playstation however it dosnt look too good by todays standards. The gamecube port looks 10x better and keeps most of the core gameplay and elements as opposed to the modern day remasters.

\- if you plan on emulating any of these, then a controller def will makes the experience better! I use a offbrand wired xbox 360 controller but there are also alternatives for a more premium experience. 8bitdo on amazon offers SNES and N64 themed gamepads but the N64 one is a bit costly.

Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion.

A few GBC games like Shantae and the Zelda Oracle series have a special, more contrasted color palette if it detects that it's running on a GBA because the screen was a lot worse than the GBC. Circle of the Moon, a launch title, was considered almost unplayable and the sequel, Harmony of Dissonance, went with a crazy colorful palette and added an ugly blue border around the character to make the game more visible. The Donkey Kong Country ports saturated the colors to try to make them easier to see, which makes them pretty horrible on the GB Player or the DS. The GBA is one of my favorite console and the hardware of the original model was great, but that screen was a joke, even for the time, the GB Pocket had a backlight years earlier without sacrificing battery life.

I wouldn't say the screen was worse than GBC. Rather, some games such as Circle of the Moon had dark color. It should've had a brightness feature like say A Link To the Past + Four Swords did. Harmony of Dissonance also had dark colors. In other words, while some games took the screen into account, other games didn't. Think of the games on Gameboy that they didn't take the screen's quality into consideration. The GBC they knew how to make a good game with a not so great screen. GBA was new and since they had more color opitions than GBC, they made it more detailed, but some detailed games are hard to see on the GBA. Castlevania is a dark series, and when I mean dark, I mean color-wise. DKC Country GBA and SMA games were meant on the OG GBA. Some games don't look as good as the OG Hardware, and this is the case.

The other advantage of the Pi 3 is that it is more able to handle Playstation games. I've run several without a hitch. It runs a few N64 games but not many, more due to the poor state of N64 emulation.

Diamond/Pearl are next. Frankly, I was not impressed. Didn't bother finishing them. I believe D/P were DS editions. After that, you get Black/White (again, DS), B/W2 (again, DS) and then the 3DS entries - X/Y, OR/AS.

Do they get massacred?, No. Despite there being 1 million immigrants in China, I've never seen a black person, a white person or any foreigner for that matter being blatantly attacked or murdered for their race like they do in America.

There are loads of different unique shops, you can see reviews, the amount of sales they have made and how long they have been on ETSY for so it is easy to see who is reliable! You can also use PayPal if you wish to make your purchase, and you can message the sellers who from my experience seem to be very helpful and fast with replies. 

So far I have bought several gameboy and gameboy colour reproductions but they do everything from nes and beyond, you can also find reproduction game cases and manuals, you should check it out.

vafz6z,ic316l9,2,"1) When I was 8 or 9, we were homeless and moved in with my cousins. My uncle took us to the store and we bought a Sega Genesis that came with the 6-Pac. 

That night, my uncle and I played straight through Streets of Rage 1. I still remember that day with perfect detail.

2) When my life as a pre-teen was at rock bottom, I was playing FF7. It took awhile to beat, and to this very day, I've been putting off replaying it because the soundtrack sends me into a depression 

3) I played hooky with a friend when I was 9, he had a Sega Channel. We went to his house and played Toy Story, swapping the controller per death. We literally beat that whole game in an afternoon. It was so much fun.

4) Back in these days, a lot of the hottest games on PS1 came on demo discs. I remember playing Legend of Dragoon and Legend of Legaia that way. I played it over,

And over,

And over.

One day my mom took me to Sears and they had Legend of Dragoon on sale for $39.99 (that would've been like 59.99 these days). But she couldn't afford it, so we never got it.

5) I got Pokemon Red when I was 9, a year after it was released. I was hooked, I used to hide in the bathroom after bed time hours to play in secret.",1655039283.0

Personally I feel like street fighter alpha 2 and super street fighter 2/turbo are more enjoyable on the psx as alpha 2 is more polished in gold edition and super street fighter 2 and turbo editions are combined to offer the best of both combined as super street fighter 2 turbo. Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion. 

For reproductions (should you go that route) /u/wildertronix offers some very reasonable prices. I got terranigma and secret of mana 2 for $30 each.

Answering this separately because I didn't answer it with my other comment:

The Oracle games are meant to be played as two halves of one larger game, but neither half is ""first"". When you beat one game, you get a password to transfer your game to the other one, and you can do them in either order. There is no canonical ""first"" or ""second"" one. The games change slightly depending on the order you play them in, and there's an extra ending you can get only if you play both games.",1599668632.0
iphmaf,g4k2aef,3,"> How do the GBC versions differ from GBA?

There are no ""GBA versions"" of the Oracle games. There are bootleg carts in GBA shells, for some reason, but they're the same as the GBC carts, just smaller.

There is a special shop that can only be accessed by playing the game on a GBA, but the game itself is still a GBC game.",1599667077.0

887to7,dwil2vo,1,"Since my most recent is James Bond 007, I'll pimp that a little bit. 

This was a game I owned as a kid, but never beat. Both the controls and the perspective are very reminiscent of Link's Awakening (and the game even has a couple trading sequences). the story is filled with the usual cast of James Bond characters and villains, including Q, M, Moneypenny, Jaws, and Oddjob. Throughout the game, Bond gets access to several different weapons and tools, including a laser watch, machete, pistol, machine gun, and rocket launcher (among others). The game takes you to several different locations across the globe in 11 levels of varying length and difficulty. The story was very reminiscent of many of the movies: you have to discover the identity of an unknown person attempting to throw the world into chaos by piecing together clues from each place you go. The strengths of the game include combat using a wide array of weapons, a nice variety of locations, the puzzles, and the inclusion of casino games. The only drawback is that a couple levels require significant backtracking. The game can get quite challenging if you aren't thorough; many of the health packs and weapons are hidden in boxes and chests, and they are easy to miss if you aren't willing to ""search"" each one (you simply have to walk up to one and press A or B, so it's not a huge time commitment, there's just a lot of them throughout the game and most are empty). Although this game wasn't well received when it was released, I think it's aged well. In my opinion, it's a good, fun game, especially for fans of James Bond. The puzzle elements make it feel more like a James Bond movie than Goldeneye or any of the subsequent FPS games, but the action is in no way lacking. Overall, I'd give it a 4/5.",1522384735.0

6ybbup,dmmsk04,1,"> I could never understand why any gamer would want to use a keyboard.

For me, it's a case of access to more functions available to me at any point. I play a few games that really require that functionality and on which they couldn't reasonably be replicated using a joypad, like the *Arma* games with their plethora of different options or racing simulators or flight simulators where I fit as much as I can on the wheel or joystick, but there are still functions that are left over. Also, strategy games tend to work better with a K&M layout, because you can issue certain commands far more quickly with a single button press on a keyboard than you can with just a mouse or with an analogue joypad. Also, I didn't even have a joystick for my PC until the mid-2000s, so even in games where I could have used one to good effect, like *BattleZone* or *MechWarrior 3*, I instead used K&M controls and got used to them in those games.

The one thing I miss on FPS games in particular is analogue control of movement, but that's not a deal-breaker. And there are a few genres nowadays where I'd just plug in a DualShock 3 and play with that instead. ",1504694054.0

The hurdle then is figuring out a way to duplicate the copy protection from the original CDs onto the new CDs. There could be some real issues with that, this might require expensive custom equipment at the CD pressing plant that basically doesn't exist anymore, replicating the ideosyncratic copy protection might be challengeable as an infringement of copyright (the PSX emulator Bleem cited this as one reason that it did not seek to include a copy protection mechanism akin to what the PS1 did to distinguish between real discs and cdrs).",1612290332.0

Capcom, for instance, has already done officially licensed reproductions of Super Nintendo games, so it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't be similarly interested in PS1 or Saturn titles, especially if they could be sold at a premium.

The ODE point is an interesting one. No doubt those are popular devices that are changing the landscape for the disc-based consoles, but by the same token you can make the same argument for the popularity of flashcarts on cartridge-based systems, and yet clearly cartridge reproductions are still financially viable. I suspect that people who go to the trouble to install an ODE are a niche within a niche.",1612296701.0
lb1s2c,glrgeid,2,"Yeah, I guess the frustration there is ... listen, all due respect to Night Trap, which is a trailblazing game and has some interesting ideas, but ... it's not really what I still want to play in 2021. I'm glad it exists! But it's not my thing.

The copy protection is a point, but I'm making a (admittedly uninformed) leap that that's a surpassable issue with official approval/cooperation. Basically, I'm assuming given a sufficiently large manufacturing run and through the right channels that the needed copy protection can be incorporated. But I don't know how the PS1 and Saturn copy protections work, so maybe that's a bigger challenge that I've realized.",1612290302.0

d1fhfd,ezovaux,1,"I think you may have found some way to fit 35 questions into one post and I’m legitimately impressed.

To try to answer them:

• Everything Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4 you should be able to find at GameStop and contrary to what you have said it seems as though I can’t go into a store without seeing them. I mean if you’re even super desperate there’s always Walmart. 

•GameStop has Wii games. DS games as well.

• it would help if you told us what general area you live in (like what country and if you live in the US, what state) that way people can give you more local recommendations of the best stores to go to for each thing.

• Facebook marketplace is a good way to find local people selling used games/systems and is usually reasonably priced

• to aid your eBay concerns, set up saved searches and alerts for those searches, be willing to look at auctions and not just buy it now, and be sure to sort by price and watch certain items you like. Also don’t be afraid to look at bigger lots if you have the money. And foreign languages and pirated, while they definitely exist on eBay, can very easily be avoided by making sure you read descriptions on items before you buy them, make sure you read seller reviews and don’t buy from foreign countries unless you’re specifically buying something that didn’t come out in your country.

• GameCube and Gameboy advance, Xbox OG, PS2 all on eBay and Facebook marketplace or online on GameStop.
 
• I’ve surprisingly found a lot of used PS1’s on FB marketplace and Goodwill. They’re really not hard to find but that’s where I’d start. You can also buy them used on GameStop’s website. And worst comes to worst there are plenty of eBay lots.

•Definitely recommend SNES, NES, Genesis, and PS1 minis if you just want to play the games easily on a modern TV for a reasonable price

• Mario Baseball, Sunshine, and Wind Waker are by no means hard to find, they are slightly more expensive than most GameCube games. But eBay and GameStop and FB are your friend. Again, set up eBay alerts for these specific games.

• [Ratchet and Clank PS2](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F163853906957), there are several variants but none of them seem very hard to find

• Pokémon GBA games are also not hard to find but are expensive. Educate yourself on how to spot fakes because there are a lot of fakes for those games you mentioned. I would recommend buying Pokémon games in person so you can inspect them thoroughly before you buy. 

•Every game you listed after the Pokémon games please just set up eBay alerts for. Thank you for educating me that there is a GTA advance game, I will be buying that.

• In respect to the online services for PS3 being shut down, I haven’t played those specific games but if they’re online only then it would not make sense to buy them as you wouldn’t be able to play them. If they aren’t online only, then get them if they’re something you want to play.

• [Little Big Planet PS3](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F174024448053) 

• [Forza Motorsport 2 Xbox 360](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F323907103083)

I notice that in my Walmarts or Targets, that older games like Battlefield Hardline or Killzone Shadow Fall aren't sold as much.

GameStop does have DS and Wii games? Even GTA Chinatown Wars on DS and Call of Duty on DS and Wii? Even Sonic or Zelda TP or Metroid trilogy (both Wii and Gamecube)?

&#x200B;

i've dealt with some sellers in the past who listed US addresses (ex: Chicago) but sold and shipped from China or other countries and those games were pirated.

And how do the minis compare to the original consoles? Will a lot of consoles be in bad condition? 

&#x200B;

What exactly do eBay alerts do?

&#x200B;

The problems were many, but was too expensive if you didn't have a subsidy from your carrier and the screen was vertical instead of horizontal. That last one wasn't bad for original games, but proved problematic for the many ports.

6jess7,dje1b4f,3,"I never have liked the idea of mobile gaming on a phone. Petty little time wasting apps and games are fine, but you just can't sink your teeth into serious gaming on them for a few good reasons. One, a phone is primarily a tool for communication, and it's potentially a piece of emergency equipment if you have to call for help in a life threatening situation. I don't want to try to dial for emergency services only to realize I've killed my battery from playing games. Second, phones get hot, especially when trying to run higher end games, and electronics don't get along so well with heat. Most smartphones today will automatically shut off when they hit a certain temperature, but do you really want to be interrupted that way while you're trying to enjoy yourself? And lastly, mobile gaming has led to a decline in enthusiasm by game makers to invest in dedicated gaming handhelds. This is especially true of Sony and their excellent Vita. Mobile gaming is sucking the drive out of developers and instead we're getting the latest knock off candy crush garbage game. And that's another thing, the vast majority of mobile gaming is mindless fruit ninja swipe action casual bilge. AAA titles can't survive in a marketplace that is ruled by huge demand for cheap gimmicky titles, and that is precisely why we aren't seeing as many for the Vita anymore. I understand this is the free market in action and there are exceptions and work arounds to the trend but I hate the direction that mobile gaming has taken gaming in general. And the N-Gage pioneered it to large degree. I'm voting that bad boy off with pleasure. ",1498421518.0

RIP: N-Gage.",1498618298.0
6jess7,djduxyo,2,"It's amazing how much disparity there was between the all-conquering Game Boy Advance and everything else that went up against it (not only true handhelds, but also things like the Tapwave Zodiac). As I said in the last round, the N-Gage was built around a good idea, namely to combine handheld gaming with a mobile phone platform at a time when mobile phones were becoming increasingly popular, but was poorly planned, poorly executed and ended up with a slightly unfair reputation despite the original model not being optimal for either gaming or use as a mobile phone and the later model suffering because of the reputation of the first phone.

Because I said pretty much all I had to say in the last round about the N-Gage and because I don't have any personal experience with it, while I have extensive personal experience with the Game Boy Advance, I'm going to focus more on the merits - and some demerits - of the Nintendo system here to show that it's more than just a default choice in this round.

In hardware terms, the Game Boy Advance was the true revolution over the Game Boy Color that the Game Boy Color had not been over the original Game Boy. In simplified terms, you could think of the GBA as a mobile SNES, although without the ability to practically put in additional CPUs into the cartridges like the SNES, the CPU was by necessity a lot more powerful than that in the SNES, being closer to a SNES with a SuperFX chip than a base SNES unit.  The system also had superior sprite-handling capabilities to the SNES as well and I would argue that the peak of Game Boy Advance graphics was more technically impressive than the SNES using anything other than a SuperFX chip, even if the lower resolution of the GBA's screen was a bit of a limitation. (**EDIT:** Actually, thinking about it more, there are games on the Game Boy which are more technically impressive, including the likes of *V-Rally 3*, *Asterix & Obelix XXL* and *Super Monkey Ball Jr.*)

Even on its own, not counting backwards compatibility, the Game Boy Advance's library is spectacular. Between the incredible *Metroid Fusion*, the excellent *Advance Wars* series and *Final Fantasy Tactics Advance* (which led me to wonder why turn-based strategy and strategy RPG games weren't pushed harder on handhelds before, given that they're so well suited to handheld gaming), the innovative and wildly fun *WarioWare* titles, the solid *Mario Kart: Super Circuit*, which I think is an underrated installment in the series, three *Castlevania* titles, two generations of *Pokémon*, *The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap*, *Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga* and two favourites of mine in the *Golden Sun* series, among a host of other titles worth checking out, the original offerings on the system alone are remarkable for their strength and diversity. That's before you get to the remakes and ports from previous systems, like *Metroid: Zero Mission*, *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (incorporating *Four Swords*), the *Super Mario Advance* series, five different *Final Fantasy* remakes, a surprisingly competent and playable port of *Doom* (even if the soundtrack was notoriously poor) and the first English-language port of *Tales of Phantasia*. Even Nintendo's old adversaries, Sega, got in on the party, with Sega themselves releasing several *Sonic Advance* titles and Camelot Software Planning developing the aforementioned *Golden Sun* titles along with a remake of *Shining Force*. 

Then, on top of that, you have the entire back catalogue of games from the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, comprising two full generations and what was then 12 years of backwards compatibility. The system started with a colossal library which only grew bigger from there. That was a massive feather in the cap of Nintendo, particularly given that there were still Game Boy Color titles worth playing being released in 2001 including the exceptional *The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages* and *Oracle of Seasons*. And you also have the Game Boy Player add-on for the GameCube, which gives you a way to play all three systems' games on a television screen (or, as I usually did, my top-mounted LCD screen on my GameCube), including full link cable capabilities. Let's just say that it always relieved the burden of trying to enter the full password to transfer my save data from *Golden Sun* to its sequel.

Like the Game Boy Color before it, the Game Boy Advance was a historically important handheld system for me, continuing my path down Nintendo fanboyism and leading me to get a GameCube in the one part of my life in which I owned a console that was more powerful than my PC. I'm torn between it and the Nintendo DS as my favorite handheld ever, but something in the Game Boy Advance's favour is that it was a perfect Game Boy and Game Boy Color in a way that the Nintendo DS wasn't a perfect Game Boy Advance.

Nevertheless, having used my Game Boy Advance so much, I'm willing to admit that it's not without its faults. The biggest weakness of the system has traditionally been held to be its sound chip. I'll admit that I didn't really notice this when I was younger, since I expected handhelds to have poorer sound chips than home consoles. In retrospect, though, I think Nintendo really dropped the ball with respect to that aspect. Failing to learn a lesson from the Jaguar and even their own Nintendo 64 beforehand, Nintendo equipped the Game Boy Advance with a disgracefully limited sound system for the time, bolting two PWM channels making up twin 8-bit DACs onto the pre-existing Game Boy PSG and expecting developers to either stream music or find spare CPU cycles to mix wave samples in software.

While it was certainly possible to generate good music from such a setup - Shin'en Multimedia did a very good job with their *Iridion* games, while I'm convinced that Motoi Sakuraba made some sort of demonic pact to get the music of *Golden Sun* to sound so good - it regularly ended up with muddy results caused by low sample rates and a similar lack of crisp drum sounds as happened with the SNES, even in Nintendo first-party titles like *Metroid Fusion*. And it got worse, with travesties like the soundtrack from *Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance*, which barely seems to have touched the DAC channels at all. Overall, Nintendo could have done a much better job in this department, particularly given all of the SNES titles that got ported and consequently ended up with crippled soundtracks compared to the originals.

Speaking of SNES ports, Nintendo could have and should have included the X and Y buttons on the system, rather than waiting until the DS to add them. While developers obviously found ways around the lack of face buttons, I can't see any reason for Nintendo not to include them apart from contrariness, particularly as they were porting a variety of their own SNES games onto the system.

Finally, with all of the hardware revisions of the Game Boy Advance, they still didn't manage to make one that I find ideal. The SP 101, that is representing the system in this round, is the one that I find to be the best overall, but it's less comfortable than the original model and it would have been nice to get the original form factor with a backlight without having to mod it personally.",1498412584.0

FF: Tactics on ps1 is one of my favorite games of all time but the GBA Tactics never did much for me. The judge system totally lost me. I went into one of the first few fights, swung my sword, and the character got flagged by the judge. I turned it off shortly thereafter, and started a new game of Tactics on ps1.

I like the inclusion of Dr. Mario/Puzzle League. Few people seem to realize that Dr. Mario on this cart is based on the N64 version rather than the NES or other Game Boy versions. Great cart. Got it CIB for just a few bucks, great value.

Honestly all three Castlevania games deserve a spot. For being part of the same series on the same system, the games are remarkably different from each other. Same with the Metroid games.

I have poured more hours into Tactics Advance than any other game on the system, the PS1 game is one of my personal favorites as well, it's just a highly addictive and deep series. The judge system did hinder my enjoyment somewhat, but I still found myself glued for hours and that's a rarity for an attention span like mine.

And I absolutely loved Dr. Mario/Puzzle League, I remember buying it when it was released. Handheld gaming and puzzle games go hand in hand (no pun intended... Maybe.), I remember playing it on the school bus and road trips to Dallas and Branson. Puzzle League may very well be my favorite puzzle game of all time, my dad and I stil play Tetris attack on the SNES to this day! (In case anyone reading this isn't aware, Tetris Attack is a version of puzzle league released on the SNES.)

I absolutely love Metroidvania style games, they do a great job at combining non linear gameplay with fast paced action. The boss battles in the Castlevania games were especially fun, they seemed to be a throwback to the classic Caatlevania boss fights, especially Circle of the Moon's boss battles. Aria of Sorrow really hit the spot for me, it was most similar to symphony of the night which is my favorite game of all time, and to this day I still consider it to be the second best game in the series, and the best gba game of all time.

As far as Sacred Stones is concerned, I played it s couple of times but never really owned it so I can't really speak on it unfortunately though I am a big fan of the first GBA game so I'm sure it's just as good. ",1476596865.0

57oq4b,d8uttyw,3,"Aria of Sorrow is my second favorite game in the entire series, it's so damn good, Symphony of Night is my all time favorite game, Aria of Sorrow is the closest the series ever got to the perfection that was Symphony of the Night (excluding the shoddy voice acting.). I remember picking up the Castlevania double pack on the gba years ago and that was my first experience with the series as well, I had played the original Castlevania a couple of times at the daycare I went to as a kid but this was my first real experience with the series. I think the boss fights are my favorite part of Aria of Sorrow, each boss felt truly epic and you felt a real sense of accomplishment when you beat them and leveled up. 

I remember getting so frustrated with Mega Man Zero as a kid, I could not make it past a certain boss and threw my gba so hard that it hit my wall and the battery cover flew off and batteries landed on my shelf, it was one of the hardest side scrollers I had played next to Contra III. I will have to try that, I had never really stopped to think about that, I actually recently bought zero 2 on the Wii u virtual console so I'm sure that will help. I personally just prefer Sonic Advance over Mega Man Zero, not for reasons of difficulty, I just really enjoy the pacing of the 2d sonic games, it's instantly satisfying and works great as a portable game that I can pick up and play for a half hour. Astro Boy is such an under appreciated gem on the gba, Treasure is one of my favorite developers of all time and Astro Boy really helped cement my opinion. It was a perfect throwback to the glory days of 16 bit games and felt like Treasures take on a Mega Man style game get added their own signature quirky twist on the gameplay, I love how they put some shoot em up stated levels in there as well, it's seriously one of the most enjoyable side scrollers I've ever played.",1476653178.0

Otherwise I would already have more than half the list taken up with Final Fantasies, Marios, and various selections from the Classic NES Series.

FF VI will always be a favorite of mine as well. Just too many good memories of it as a kid. I remember when I was a kid and I rented it for SNES (of course it was Final Fantasy 3 for us back then), and the rental place made copies of the instruction manuals so people couldn't just steal the manuals. My mom had business at the bank afterward, and I remember very vividly over 20 years later now, sitting in the chair and flipping through the manual and reading about relics and Espers, and the lady at the bank asking what I was looking at, and me doing my best to describe it in a non-crazy-sounding manner. Just one of those random game memories that's really vivid that I loved about gaming back then as a kid.

As for Mario Advance 2 and 4, you hit the nail on the head for me there. Certainly the best of the four games in that series, not that 1 and 3 are bad by any means.

From the Classic NES Series I would have to include both Zeldas, Castlevania, and Metroid (although I could cheat and just say Metroid Zero Mission since you can just unlock the original Metroid on it). Original Mario would make the list, but I think the Advance series would make up for its absence honestly.

Breath of Fire 1 and 2 would be easy picks from the SNES port category as well. The first two Donkey Kong Country games as well.
Add in Zelda: A Link to the Past and the Phantasy Star Collection, and I think our list of awesome ports would be pretty complete. I could honestly hit a top 25 list of just ports. I may just try that in my spare time.",1476755060.0

I do actually like it quite a bit (it does get some hate), and I think the addition of a class system was a huge plus for the game. Sure, you probably want to check out a guide on your first playthrough because the class system is kind of (extremely) vague about requirements, and accidentally messing up and getting the wrong class is exceptionally easy.

I first checked out IX but rented final fantasy anthology from blockbuster when it came out, I was seriously blown away by how great the game was for being as old as it was (this was during the ps1/n64 era when everyone shat on 2d games), the sprite work, script, and the music were all so elegant. My mom had even said something along the lines of ""that music is beautiful"" and she had rarely, if ever talked about video games so that was pretty big. The opening sequence is probably my favorite in any video game ever, the music that plays during the sequence is absolutely phenomenal, its amazing what the composer was able to pull off without cd quality audio.

And yes that's why I didn't include ports myself, I really wanted people that aren't familiar with the systems library to know about the original games. I really love Yoshi's island as well, it was one of my favorite games as a kid and still is one of my all time faves, it's just that Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World are what I consider to be the definitive platforming experience.

em1qem,fdmirkp,2,"All of this is subjective and this is not to say you're ""wrong"", but I have the opposite opinion of you about the NES and the SNES. The precision and uniqueness of NES platformers make them timeless to me. Yes, you'll have to dig through some crap (ESPECIALLY in Japan, in the US just avoid western developed stuff and you're fine), but I'm confident the 50 or so best platformers are largely agreed on now. The depth of the artwork in things like Kabuki Quantum Fighter and Low G Man will always make me feel at home. But to be fair, you have to be pretty damn good at games to get through most of them.

The SNES at the time made everything seem amazing. The graphics were so crisp and colorful, pretty much any game given a decent amount of effort looked tantalizing. But after time passes and you separate the great from the average, the SNES has a lot less action games that stand the test of time in my opinion. Things like Magical Quest or Joe and Mac are just way too bland for me. No one can deny that Super Mario World is still fun, although I feel like Yoshi's Island is just tedious. The SNES is a weird console in a way, because so many of the best games were AAA titles. Castlevania and Megaman are truly some of the best action games on the console. The Genesis was much different, for example as much as I love Sonic, it can't hold a candle to Treasure's games.

The one thing the SNES has going for it is the RPGs. They really taught us how the genre should be done. For me, RPGs are almost always a once through affair, so as great as the ones on the SNES are, they aren't going to have me playing again and again throughout the years. With a couple special exceptions.

Of course it's a must have console and gave us some of the best games of all time. But the NES gives me way more play time after the fact. Just my two cents.",1578551394.0
em1qem,fdmjysv,2,"It's a great console, some of my favourite games ever are on the SNES (DKC trilogy and FF6) but as good as some of the other classics are e.g. Mario World, Mario Kart, F-Zero, Super Metroid, Castlevania 4, Contra 3, Secret of Mana, Zelda, etc I think those games have been improved upon and the SNES also seems to lack certain genres.

I don't know if I could pick a favourite console ever, if I look at my top 50 favourite games, they mostly span from SNES gen to PS2 gen. Now that I think about it, the PS2 has a pretty strong case, if you consider it can also play all PS1 games, so that's two huge libraries of games on one console. Technically an early model PS3 would be even better.

There is actually a good case to be made for modern consoles, there are a lot of great modern games in many genres and even really good titles that try to replicate some of those old 16 bit games or just direct ports of old games. I also think that while the absolute best games ever might be on certain consoles like SNES or PS1, I think that the overall quality has probably improved over time, what I mean is that there are probably a lot more good games overall, on modern systems even if the very best games aren't quite as good as the very best from an older console.

This isn't to say the SNES wasn't a fantastic console in its time or even still today. There are a lot of good games on it. I know in 1995 I thought the SNES was the best console ever and I think I'd still say that the SNES was better than any console that came before it ( I think the Mega Drive was pretty close but not quite as good, though it actually still gets new games to this day, very occasionally).",1578552696.0

em1qem,fdsabt4,1,">The NES was a revolution

I'm not convinced it was. Remember that while the NES may have replaced the 2600 in terms of market supremacy in the US, there were systems like the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit systems already on the market with substantially more sophisticated graphics and sound than the Atari 2600. The Famicom/NES was an evolution, [using an upgraded adaptation of the same Texas Instruments TMS99x8 already used in the likes of the TI-99/4A and the ColecoVision](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/6wosd7/tms9918_designer/) and a sound chip with substantially less flexibility per channel than the SID in the Commodore 64. By the time the NES came out in the US, the Amiga had already been released.

>Many new genres and great franchises really started on the NES, such as platformers, rpgs, action side-scrollers.

Scrolling platformers were being designed in parallel in the arcade, with games like *Pac-Land* and *Ghosts 'n Goblins*. The JRPG owed a lot to the CRPG genre already in progress on the home computers of the time (which in turn owed their development to TTRPGs, most prominently *Dungeons & Dragons*). Action side-scrollers were also being developed in parallel in the arcade. While the NES provided polished examples of the genres, their development was in progress elsewhere and the genres would have taken some shape even if the NES had never existed.

>The scope of games was vastly expanded.

I'd argue that was as much to do with the home computer market as the resurgent console market - and few things on the NES reached the scope of *Elite*, *The Lords of Midnight* or *Exile* from the British home computer market or the many CRPGs being developed by the American home computer developers at the time. Again, the NES provided great improvements over the Atari 2600, but so did other platforms at the time.

I have no contentions with your suggestions that NES games felt a bit raw as developers were trying out new tricks and building the foundations of later genres and that SNES games refined the formula of those genres to provide some of the best examples of their generation, but I think that's a general 8-bit -> 16-bit trend rather than because the NES provided any great revolutions in the video game market rather than being a competently-designed system marketed well with a strong library and a market vacuum to expand into.",1578698003.0
em1qem,fdnfaxk,1,"Hah, me too.

The SNES graphics will never go out of style.  Sure, consoles after it can do better 2D graphics, but the SNES visuals are still great.  Unlike the NES which looks quite dated.

This is why I don't get why indie devs often seem to stick to the NES style when making a new game these days.  Shovel Knight and Axion Verge are the two that jump to mind that do this.  They both have great gameplay, but the graphics feel extremely dated.

1. Shin Megami Tensei series (Famicom, SNES, PS2, etc.) great spooky games with story-lines involving demons, end of the world scenarios and more than a few dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.

2. The Thing (PS2, XBOX) Game based off of the horror/thriller movie of the same name, it really got under my skin the last time I played it. Meant to give you a sense of you never know who you can trust, and I feel it does it pretty well.

3. The Suffering 1&2 (XBOX) Game where you are a prisoner on death row, when, right before your execution, all hell breaks loose. The great part about this game, to me, was the story it told through the environment and enemies. The island your stuck on has a truly screwed up history and they spare no details in explaining it to you. 

4. Silent Hill (PS1, PS2, Xbox, Wii, 360, PS3) This one is probably cheating, they are spooky, you have limited resources, OMG!

5. Majuu Ou - King of Demons (SNES) One I don't hear mentioned much, but it's a great SNES game with great music and game play that is a mix if Castlevania and Contra. It was a Super Famicom exclusive, but fan-translations exist out there so its easy to enjoy. 

6. Decap attack- A game made by Viktokai, all of whose games are pretty similar. This game those has some actual new elements. A great weird game. Game Grumps played it last Halloween, it was enjoyable to see as I grew up with that game on my Sega.

And That's all I can think of at the moment. I always work nights and will be working nights through Halloween, but thankfully its just answering phones, so if no one is calling I'll be playing spooky games. Enjoy and hope you saw a few new games in here!

I would also reccomend Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti on the Famicom, it's  a fun Halloween game as well, it's more of a platformer than the other games, and it's more cutesy but still has some gore. You can't download it on any VC service but can easily be found on emulators and there are repro carts if you want to play it on your NES.

Luigi's Mansion is a much more ""spooky"" game obviously, considering its part of the Mario franchise but it's still a really fun game to play around this time of year. Also for some movie reccomendations: I have become a real fan of the Evil Dead series, Evil Dead 2 in particular, it's the pinnacle of 80's horror movies in my opinion, it's low budget but done so right that I would consider it to be the greatest B horror movie of all time, the use of claymation and puppets is so awesome. Fun fact: Splatterhouse is full of nods to the movie, I won't spoil it for you but there are enemies that resemble characters in the movie and some of the plot seems to borrow from the movie as well.

SNES and Gamecube both have excellent installments of Metroid ;-) Plus, Super Game Boy (SNES) and Game Boy Player (Game Cube) would let you play your GB games on the TV too; it's convenient sometimes.

**o Original Xbox**  
o jet set radio future   


Some additonal notes

\- some of these games such as metal gear solid are my personal favorites

\- I play the original jet set radio. never played future but it looks awesome and is a big game suggestion in the jet set radio community!

\- Many people consider the original Resident evil a classic for playstation however it dosnt look too good by todays standards. The gamecube port looks 10x better and keeps most of the core gameplay and elements as opposed to the modern day remasters.

\- if you plan on emulating any of these, then a controller def will makes the experience better! I use a offbrand wired xbox 360 controller but there are also alternatives for a more premium experience. 8bitdo on amazon offers SNES and N64 themed gamepads but the N64 one is a bit costly.

I've owned all of them, including some of the rarer ones like [Dirt Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_Racer) and [Dirt Trax FX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_Trax_FX).  I dunno if it's because a lot of people play them on emulators now with increased FPS, but it's painful playing them due to the low frame rates.

Uniracers is a legit classic though, it's got excellent potential for a 3D remake with some online multiplayer.

Cybernator is awesome, I highly recommend [this patch](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/775/).  A lot of stuff was chopped out of the English versions and this patch restores it.

Cannon Fodder needs a mouse to be able to play it properly, the SNES version didn't support it.

Don’t really remember the Atari except Donkey Kong. My stepmother sold it. First played an NES at my cousin’s house. She had Bubble Bobble and I was hooked. Got my NES, Bubble Bobble and Mario 2 for my birthday in July of ‘88. Just had the NES until years after the SNES debuted. I was definitely on the Nintendo side of the console wars. My mom told me that if I picked up all of the black walnuts in the yard, (we have 20 trees) hulled them, shelled them, and bagged them to sell, she’d use some of the money to buy me a super Nintendo! I worked all fall of ‘93 picking up walnuts. Unfortunately, she was not able to keep her part of the promise due to bills and things. She promised she would try to get me one for Christmas though. Well, Christmas came and my mother betrayed me. She got me a Genesis! But it was OK, because she bought it from her coworker and it came with 50 (!) games. I was suddenly a Sega fan.  I kept with genesis until the N64 came out. I wanted it for one reason. Mario 64. (Now THATS a killer app!) Eventually, I ran across a 2nd gen SNES for $20 and a bunch of cheap preplayed games at Roses dept. Store and added it to my collection. I realize how lucky I was now, because those “Cheap” games were Mario World. Mario All-Stars, Super Metroid, Final Fantasy 3, R-Type 3, Contra 3, etc. Eventually, I really got into arcade fighting games, so when the Dreamcast was announced I had to buy it.

8pwluf,e0eon3d,1,"Some of my all-time favorite SNES games on there.

Energy Breaker is in fact probably my favorite JRPG on the system.  It's worth noting that the characters, dialogue, music and graphics are all top-notch.

Metal Max Returns is another favorite.  Between the highly customizable tanks, the essentially open world exploration, the amusing characters and the surreal and silly post-apocalyptic crapsack world, it just amuses the hell out of me.

Nice to see Chaos Seed there.  I think it's a great game and almost never see it mentioned.  It's definitely unlike anything else and is a neat combination of exploration, combat and world-building.

Marvelous is... well... marvelous.  It's fascinating and amusing and challenging - a great indication of things to come from Eiji Aonuma, who later went on to be lead designer on A Link to the Past and is now the series producer for the entire Zelda franchise.

Shiren the Wanderer just might be my all-time favorite rogue-like.  It's the one I go back to most often (and I still haven't beaten it).

I just started playing Super Robot Wars Gaiden: Masō Kishin – The Lord Of Elemental a few weeks ago, when the English patch was released.  I think it's very impressive, though it's a bit odd for a SRW game, since all of the battles take place on the ground and elevation and facing make a difference (and quite a significant one at that).  It's a surprisingly difficult game, but a lot of fun.  And it's nice to see Masaki's history.

Gunple is awesome.  It's like a cross between A Link to the Past, Earthbound and the movie Cowboys & Aliens.  It's just one of those games that doesn't take itself seriously, and benefits from it.

Great list.",1528588954.0

yih7df,iuio3v4,2,"Just in time to end my month of Castlevania for October I finished Dawn of Sorrow. This is a great game to end on as it's the last game as far as in game cannon is concerned. The graphical upgrade from Aria of Sorrow to Dawn of Sorrow is the first thing I noticed because this is a beautiful game all around. The movement, the backgrounds, the enemy sprite's, and the weapons all look fantastic on the DS even all these years later.  I enjoyed the music throughout most of Dawn of Sorrow and the overall game design is done pretty well. This is a game that has you more or less work your way to the castle center then work your way out in multiple directions throughout the journey. There are a lot of warp rooms making backtracking less arduous and the overall atmosphere is pretty fun to explore. The story starts off ridiculous and somehow actually manages to catch up to itself and be one of the better plots in Castlevania. The gameplay and mechanics are mostly good with one pretty massive exception that I'll get to in a minute. The souls mechanic returns and feels just as satisfying as Aria, the weapon synthesis is a nice addition and gives more rewards for soul farming while still being mostly optional. The big pen shaped black eye on this game though is the soul seal gimmick that has you drawing a shape on the DS at the end of each boss fight and the boss regains some health and keeps fighting if you mess up. The later seals are actually pretty complex and it doesn't seem like much but this gimmick definitely ruins the experience for me a little bit.

3hwyyo,cubj9jm,4,"Here's what I use for 240p games:

* HDMI_Output: 720p60 (1080p60 is fine too, but not as good for scanlines)
* Image_Mode: Picture (by far the most important for pixel games, you can get away with natural if you want for 3D games like N64 and PS1 perhaps)
* Auto_Scaler: Game (also important for pixel games)
* Screen_Set: Standard ( LB2 is good for SGB/GBP )
* Sharpness (0 or 1; I prefer none)

And that's pretty much it. For 480i games I just swap image mode over to natural and autoscaler to video. Zoom_Set is like an advanced screen set; I've made some custom settings for the SGB/GBP if you want to see them there's a [screenshot album here](http://imgur.com/a/HEGtW#0).

Finally, about your noise problem in certain colors... it's a side-affect of the framemeister apparently; I see it mostly in darker solid colors as a faint waviness, but it's usually not present on screen.

1. Shin Megami Tensei series (Famicom, SNES, PS2, etc.) great spooky games with story-lines involving demons, end of the world scenarios and more than a few dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.

2. The Thing (PS2, XBOX) Game based off of the horror/thriller movie of the same name, it really got under my skin the last time I played it. Meant to give you a sense of you never know who you can trust, and I feel it does it pretty well.

3. The Suffering 1&2 (XBOX) Game where you are a prisoner on death row, when, right before your execution, all hell breaks loose. The great part about this game, to me, was the story it told through the environment and enemies. The island your stuck on has a truly screwed up history and they spare no details in explaining it to you. 

4. Silent Hill (PS1, PS2, Xbox, Wii, 360, PS3) This one is probably cheating, they are spooky, you have limited resources, OMG!

5. Majuu Ou - King of Demons (SNES) One I don't hear mentioned much, but it's a great SNES game with great music and game play that is a mix if Castlevania and Contra. It was a Super Famicom exclusive, but fan-translations exist out there so its easy to enjoy. 

6. Decap attack- A game made by Viktokai, all of whose games are pretty similar. This game those has some actual new elements. A great weird game. Game Grumps played it last Halloween, it was enjoyable to see as I grew up with that game on my Sega.

And That's all I can think of at the moment. I always work nights and will be working nights through Halloween, but thankfully its just answering phones, so if no one is calling I'll be playing spooky games. Enjoy and hope you saw a few new games in here!

558w5m,d8ahgwu,1,"Definetely Splatterhouse, the only reason anyone needs the PS3 version is to play the original games, it's the only way I know of to play the real arcade game and not the tg16 port, it also has ports of Splatterhouse 2 and 3 so it's a really good bargain considering how much physical copies of each game are going for. I would also reccomend Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti on the Famicom, it's  a fun Halloween game as well, it's more of a platformer than the other games, and it's more cutesy but still has some gore. You can't download it on any VC service but can easily be found on emulators and there are repro carts if you want to play it on your NES. I also highly encourage you to play Sweet Home, I own a repro of it and it's a fantastic game, it's so odd seeing such a dark game on the NES/Famicom. If you enjoy resident evil I would definetely reccomend checking out Silent Hill 1 and 2, they are some of the creepiest and most unsettling games I have ever played. Luigi's Mansion is a much more ""spooky"" game obviously, considering its part of the Mario franchise but it's still a really fun game to play around this time of year. Also for some movie reccomendations: I have become a real fan of the Evil Dead series, Evil Dead 2 in particular, it's the pinnacle of 80's horror movies in my opinion, it's low budget but done so right that I would consider it to be the greatest B horror movie of all time, the use of claymation and puppets is so awesome. Fun fact: Splatterhouse is full of nods to the movie, I won't spoil it for you but there are enemies that resemble characters in the movie and some of the plot seems to borrow from the movie as well.

558w5m,d89czhi,2,"Here's a fun list for ya,

1. Shin Megami Tensei series (Famicom, SNES, PS2, etc.) great spooky games with story-lines involving demons, end of the world scenarios and more than a few dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.

2. The Thing (PS2, XBOX) Game based off of the horror/thriller movie of the same name, it really got under my skin the last time I played it. Meant to give you a sense of you never know who you can trust, and I feel it does it pretty well.

3. The Suffering 1&2 (XBOX) Game where you are a prisoner on death row, when, right before your execution, all hell breaks loose. The great part about this game, to me, was the story it told through the environment and enemies. The island your stuck on has a truly screwed up history and they spare no details in explaining it to you. 

4. Silent Hill (PS1, PS2, Xbox, Wii, 360, PS3) This one is probably cheating, they are spooky, you have limited resources, OMG!

5. Majuu Ou - King of Demons (SNES) One I don't hear mentioned much, but it's a great SNES game with great music and game play that is a mix if Castlevania and Contra. It was a Super Famicom exclusive, but fan-translations exist out there so its easy to enjoy. 

6. Decap attack- A game made by Viktokai, all of whose games are pretty similar. This game those has some actual new elements. A great weird game. Game Grumps played it last Halloween, it was enjoyable to see as I grew up with that game on my Sega.

And That's all I can think of at the moment. I always work nights and will be working nights through Halloween, but thankfully its just answering phones, so if no one is calling I'll be playing spooky games. Enjoy and hope you saw a few new games in here!

558w5m,d88mpav,2,When I think of my favorite horror genre game I think of Zombies Ate My Neighbors for Sega. That game holds up. I still play it on my surface and sega mega drive. ,1475260754.0
558w5m,d8ahgwu,1,"Definetely Splatterhouse, the only reason anyone needs the PS3 version is to play the original games, it's the only way I know of to play the real arcade game and not the tg16 port, it also has ports of Splatterhouse 2 and 3 so it's a really good bargain considering how much physical copies of each game are going for. I would also reccomend Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti on the Famicom, it's  a fun Halloween game as well, it's more of a platformer than the other games, and it's more cutesy but still has some gore. You can't download it on any VC service but can easily be found on emulators and there are repro carts if you want to play it on your NES. I also highly encourage you to play Sweet Home, I own a repro of it and it's a fantastic game, it's so odd seeing such a dark game on the NES/Famicom. If you enjoy resident evil I would definetely reccomend checking out Silent Hill 1 and 2, they are some of the creepiest and most unsettling games I have ever played. Luigi's Mansion is a much more ""spooky"" game obviously, considering its part of the Mario franchise but it's still a really fun game to play around this time of year. Also for some movie reccomendations: I have become a real fan of the Evil Dead series, Evil Dead 2 in particular, it's the pinnacle of 80's horror movies in my opinion, it's low budget but done so right that I would consider it to be the greatest B horror movie of all time, the use of claymation and puppets is so awesome. Fun fact: Splatterhouse is full of nods to the movie, I won't spoil it for you but there are enemies that resemble characters in the movie and some of the plot seems to borrow from the movie as well. There's a documentary on Netflix about sleep paralysis that is absolutely terrifying, it's called the nightmare, it has people discuss their dreams and actors reinact them. ",1475386668.0

Mortal kombat 3 ultimate was my favorite mortal kombat until I discovered mortal kombat trilogy for the psx and now that one is better on the psx for me as well. Star ocean and tales of phantasia are both excellent imports/reproductions for the snes as well, however, there are psp reboots of both that are superior in my opinion.

With the sales they have been having on the eshop over the past couple weeks, I’ve picked up some really good deals on puzzle and platformer games, the most recent being the Mutant Mudds Collection. 2d platformers and Metroidvania games have always held a special place in my gaming heart, and the indie offerings for the Switch are impressive, to say the least.

Regarding the postmodernism- I feel like MGS2 beats the player over the head with the concept of nothing being real, or that the motives of the main actor are not what they seem. It's heavy handed to say the least. 

MGS1 did this in a (I can't believe I'm saying MGS is subtle) more subtle way. Because of this sort of 'less is more' (again, wow) approach to the story, MGS1 has more replay value than MGS2. 

It's entirely possible that I'm reaching here and putting postmodern concepts into a game that really wasn't attempting a postmodern message. 

I do really like the breaking of trust between the player and Campbell that naturally develops over the course of MGS2, which is not an feeling I remember encountering during MGS1.

I dunno if it's because a lot of people play them on emulators now with increased FPS, but it's painful playing them due to the low frame rates.

Uniracers is a legit classic though, it's got excellent potential for a 3D remake with some online multiplayer.

Cybernator is awesome, I highly recommend [this patch](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/775/).  A lot of stuff was chopped out of the English versions and this patch restores it.

TMNT, the first arcade game, did make it out of the arcades... on NES...it was super popular... TMNT II: The Arcade Game, even came with a free pizza.

The Contra thing is going to be lost on a US audience, Contra was insanely popular already on NES.

I disagree on Super Street Fighter II being better, it played really clunky compared to turbo.

The Genesis and the SCD game have the exact same graphics, gameplay, controls, etc.  It is, fundamentally, the exact same game.  A one-to-one copy.  Now, the SNES game, is totally different.  Different engine, different graphics, different physics, all made by different programmers.

The author says it's debatable whether the Genesis game is better than the SNES game.  But then he says ""but the SCD version definitely is better than the SNES version"".

38jpyj,crvmcsn,3,"Cool idea. I'll do mine as kind of a continuum. 

1. Combat - Atari 2600 (1977): The game is the very basis of how games can be fun based on gameplay mechanics alone. There are a ton of variations on this cart. With a friend or group of friends this is a lot of fun. 

2. Ms. Pac-Man - Arcade (1981): Pac-Man may be the O.G. but his lady is where it's at. The formula is perfect here. The game is the perfect blend of simplicity and 

3. Tetris - Game Boy (1989): Sure, there are better versions of Tetris out there. But this is the first one that popularized the game, and it also founded Nintendo's handheld empire. 

4. Super Mario World - SNES (1990): Super Mario Bros. on NES is a good game, so is Super Mario Bros. 3, but I think Super Mario World is where the formula was really perfected. The gameplay and graphics hold up well today. It's the most essential retro Mario game as far as I am concerned. 

5. Shining Force II - Genesis (1993): Shining Force was outstanding. Shining Force II is even better. This game remains one of the best strategy/tactical RPGs of all time. Ya, it's better than Final Fantasy Tactics. If I were to introduce someone into this genre, this would be the game I'd tell them to play. 

5. DOOM - PC-DOS (1993): Not the first FPS ever, but one of the most important. It was genre defining and its impact on games has been lasting. It's still fun and it gives me anxiety when playing it. I've never been scared by a game before unless I am afraid to die. This game makes me afraid to die. 

6. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles - Genesis (1994): I wish Sega used their Lock-On Technology for more games than just this one. Originally, this was meant to be a single game, but it was broken into two. Combined they are hands down the best Sonic game of all time. It's by far the biggest, most complex, and best looking of the original series. Also the most fun. 

7. Mortal Kombat Trilogy - N64/PlayStation/Saturn (1996): Mortal Kombat might not be the best fighter. But it sure is fun. Trilogy is the best of the classic series, combining all of the characters from each game into one. The N64 version is the best here due to the lack of loading times. 

8. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night - PlayStation (1997): Castlevania is one of the most classic games in history. This version also happens to be undisputedly the best game in the franchise, and some would say the best game on PlayStation. Some might argue that the Saturn version is better due to having extra characters and features, but it wasn't ever released in English, so I am sticking with the PSX version. 

9. Panzer Dragoon Saga - Saturn (1998): This RPG is simply the best game ever made in the history of ever. 'Nuff said.

I dunno if it's because a lot of people play them on emulators now with increased FPS, but it's painful playing them due to the low frame rates.

Uniracers is a legit classic though, it's got excellent potential for a 3D remake with some online multiplayer.

Cybernator is awesome, I highly recommend [this patch](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/775/).  A lot of stuff was chopped out of the English versions and this patch restores it.

Cannon Fodder needs a mouse to be able to play it properly, the SNES version didn't support it.

My man.  ISS pissed on FIFA from a great height, had much better control and features but unfortunately because it didn't have the names, I knew a lot of people who wouldn't play it.  It took FIFA a long time to reach feature parity with even the SNES version of ISS.

Then you conclude with the statement that you were lied to.

The OP makes it sound that you were lied to in reference to the CD quality audio of the console, but do you actually mean in reference to the hype about FF7 in general?

If that's the case, the OP didn't make it that clear.

> But where's the CD quality audio?? Where's the stuff the N64 couldn't do? Where's the stuff the SNES couldn't do? 

What FF7 lacks in quality it makes up in quantity. The game already came on multiple CDs and is a long RPG, and this quantity is not possible on N64. Nobody ever mandated that CD games had to have full quality CD sound instead of whatever else the developers wanted to use. I sure have heard a lot of crummy soundtracks too, but the sound quality rarely is an issue.

And even then, if we were to point out to some games that have been recognized to have great soundtracks, some of them might not even have that full quality 16bit 44.1Khz sound either, that might be true, but I have a really hard time finding the actual point of discussion here.

Less than 25,000 were sold worldwide, the best info I have is that it was on the U.S. market for 3-6 months, making it the shortest-lived console in American history. The system suffered from lack of support, too many chefs, price, retail availability, poor marketing, the level of incompetence that defined Apple in the period, and an identity crisis. 

People didn't know what the thing was, especially the general public. I never even heard of it until years later when I began collecting. It was hardly sure if it was a console or a PC, and it was a hybrid of the two. This hearkens back to earlier 90s systems like the Commodore CDTV, CD-i, and VIS which were not sure if they were game consoles or multimedia devices, and 80s consoles like Atari XEGS and Commodore 64GS which weren't sure if they were consoles or computers. This strategy has never, ever worked - not ever. We've even had attempts at this in more modern times with the DISCover platform and Steam machines. 

Like DISCover, Pippin wasn't the name of the console. In the U.S. it was called @World and in Japan is was called Atmark. (Apparently, Apple forced Bandai into the naming scheme to emphasize online capabilities. Bandai objected because most people didn't know what an @ symbol was. Email was even less widespread in Japan, so Bandai spelled it out.) Pippin is actually the name of the platform developed by Apple. Bandai wanted it to be a game console and Apple wanted it to be an all-in-one deal. Pippin was also licensed to a company called Katz Media, whose product was creatively named the Katz Media Player, which was marketed in a B2B strategy as an alternative to PCs. 

Pippin is a difficult platform to research because no one in America owned one and it was much more successful in Japan, where even there almost no one ever owned one. There's not a lot of info out there. [I put all of the info I could find on it in this old YouTube video.](https://youtu.be/gcK0zD43X58?t=382) I wish I could still locate all of the documents I came up with, most of which came from Mac enthusiast newsletters and publications. 

In the end, I am pretty sure it's the biggest loser in console history. Not the worst console ever, but the most spectacular disaster of all time. Even other losers, like NUON, and terrible consoles like Studio II, have at least one or two redeeming qualities. 

Pippin did have some Bungie support, so it has that going for it, which is nice. ",1494429557.0
6ad9t2,dhdy3pe,6,"This feels kind of like the third generation for me, in that there are three systems I feel were poor (with one having some redeeming factors if I think about it hard enough); one system which sold relatively poorly, but which has become a cult classic in some circles and two of the most notable systems there ever were, with one being an unqualified sales success and the other, while losing out in the overall sales figures, finding a markedly better performance outside of its home market. It's also the first generation where I was cognizant of what was going on at the time, although only the N64 and PlayStation actually made notable impressions on me (since, well, I had friends who played them).

There are two systems in this generation which stand out as real dogs: The VM Labs Nuon and the Apple Bandai Pippin. What comes to mind when I see both systems is a simple question: Why? 

Both systems were developed by companies with few connections in the video game industry. VM Labs apparently had connections to the Atari Jaguar through its founder Richard Miller (no, not the one from *Time Crisis*) and the game designer Jeff Minter (developer of *Tempest 2000* and also involved with the unreleased Konix Multisystem), who apparently were masochistic enough to come back for another try. 

Apple had, admittedly, built up a bit of a niche in the games industry around Mac OS - games like *System Shock* apparently played better on the Macs of the time than PCs, Bungie was a Mac exclusive developer for some time, while I experienced Mac OS gaming on the family computer of one of my friends, a Macintosh Performa on which I'd continue playing *SimCity 2000* and *SimTower*, both games coming with the Mac OS version on the same disc as the Windows 9x version - but they were going through a slump as x86 PCs became cheaper, Pentium processors markedly improved their performance at a rapid pace and the recent release of Windows 95 (an arguably uglier, but technically superior OS with pre-emptive multitasking) took the lustre off Apple's products.

As game systems, both are extremely poor. Both have miniscule libraries and very little in those libraries worth playing. The Pippin has the single best title out of the two systems by a long way in *Super Marathon*, which actually comprises a very good set of games in its own right and being a more cerebral and slightly more deep series than *Doom* or its sequel. It's hard to find anything that I'd consider worth playing on the NUON, but I'll stretch and say *Tempest 3000* just because I like the original arcade game and *Iron Soldier 3* because I gave its original predecessor a slot as a redeeming game on the Atari Jaguar.

Looking at other purposes of the two devices, I really don't understand why Richard Miller and VM Labs actually targeted games when developing the NUON, but the extra features it would have added to DVDs look like they might have had some promise. It's hard to figure out what exactly the Pippin platform was intended for other than gaming. It runs a modified Mac System 7, with the controller having a trackball in the centre, but the system was underpowered by contemporary Power Macintosh standards and lacked a hard drive, which was a necessity by that point for a proper computer.

But there is one clear deciding factor between these two systems: The price. The NUON was a shit games system and the extra features it added to DVDs didn't end up being used. However, [looking at news reports when the system was being marketed](https://books.google.ie/books?id=CRQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=nuon+dvd+player+price&source=bl&ots=2CqyrzPMMO&sig=hqznTUJinizeGuv0OwDwVcV05mk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX36WH7uXTAhVkDcAKHU_QAIM4FBDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&q=nuon%20dvd%20player%20price&f=false), a Samsung NUON-enabled DVD player with additional MP3 capacity retailed for $229 in June 2001, which was still $70 less than the launch price of the PlayStation 2, so you weren't left completely out of pocket. The Bandai @WORLD was introduced at an eye-watering $599, twice the price of a PlayStation which was already a far better games system.

There are lots of improvements, but eliminating random encounters (with monsters only moving when you do, creating an interesting tactical/puzzle element) and reworking the dungeons into a more Zelda-like format (with loads of puzzles, often involving the use of weapons/items outside of combat) really makes the game stand out.

I love the SNES, it's easily one of my favorite consoles... but as great as its library is, it can't hold a candle to the PS1, especially for JRPGs. A few that come to mind:

*Parasite Eve* and *Vagrant Story* are both relatively short games by Square with interesting realtime/turn-based hybrid combat systems, where you control your movement in realtime, but attack using a more traditional menu-based system.

*Grandia* has an extremely weak story and slightly obnoxious voicework, but the series has an absolutely fantastic combat system.

*Suikoden* and *Suikoden II* are both classics. There's a reason why *Suikoden II* was an expensive grail game even back when the PS1 was still in production (well, because it sold terribly on release and it only went through one print run, but also because it's *really good*).

8g28tj,dy99fic,2,"Final Fantasy VII is much richer experience. It's a full fledged jrpg chocked with hidden characters, plenty of memorable locations, a fantastic story, and the materia system is one of the best battle schematics ever crafted. It will take you roughly 50 hours to beat. 

Parasite Eve is an incredible but quite linear horror game with RPG elements. The story of Parasite Eve is absolutely insane in a good way, the battle system is fun but stiff, the island of Manhattan feels alive, and the gun upgrades are plentiful and rewarding. It will take roughly 20 hours to beat. 

They are two completely different games and there's no reason not to try both (they are cheap) but if you were only going to pick one id go with Final Fantasy VII.

Keep in mind both of these games have aged terribly and if you're not used to early 3D games then you're gonna be in for a shock. ",1525159329.0

I didn't beat a version of RE1 (REmake) myself until this year, and I beat RE2 almost ten years ago. RE2 was designed in the early days when the series had no true definitive continuity. The devs of RE2 basically went 'Let's do a pseudo-Final Fantasy/Zelda thing where each new game will take place somewhere different and feature different characters and stories'. It's almost completely been that way ever since sure the games had one or two characters return but they've changed the viruses, stories, and characters around to suit their needs.

I have a few games that I already beat in the past, but that I wish to re-live, with some games that I have never beat, that I wish to do so. 

But first a comment on your list, dear OP:

* Dragon Quest VIII and IX, are both gold in my book, even tho VIII is so much more enjoyable with a speed hack (frame skip, on emulator). 

* Seiken Densetsu and Vagrant Story are both masterpieces, and I've only played them half through, and you'll see them on my list too. 

Here comes my list, with 

**Games that I want to replay again**, first:

* Final Fantasy IX - One of my favourite games ever. The Soundtrack, the setting, and the atmosphere are just all top notch. Only thing that I would ever change is Kujas and Zidane's looks, to something less metro. 

* Final Fantasy XII - I know, not really retro, but it's the only other Final Fantasy title that I LOVE, and it is on my top 3 list of best video games of all time. Everything is just perfect in it, the non-standard story, the combat system and side quests, the expansive world, witch is not ""open-world"", yet still feels huge and interesting, and the characters are one of my favorites and represent really well their own backstories. Again, only thing that I would change is the metro look of some of them.

* Dragon Quest VIII and Rogue Galaxy - I am putting them on the same list, because the only PS2 era games that I plan to replay this year.

* Vagrant Story - I never beat it, but I loved the rich combat system of it, and I think it is what inspired FF XII gambits system.

* Legend of Dragoon - loved the story as a kid, I wonder if it will still hold up for me.

**Retro Games that I will attempt to beat for the first time**:

* Legend of Zelda: Windwaker - I find the GameCube to be retro, sue me.

* Xenogears. 

* Terranigma.

* Earthbound (Mother 3).

* SaGa Frontier 2 

* **Legend of Mana** - Currently playing this one, I love it so far!

* Most of the other games in the "" of Mana"" series, regardless of platform.

* The Phantasy Star, Lunar and Shinning Force series's. 

* That one Dragon Warrior (or Dragon Quest) tittle, that spans through multiple generations and takes forever to beat.

That's from the top of my head, for now. I will add as I am finishing those, oh and I will completely devote my self to only retro gaming this year, and I will only one game at a time.

The devs of RE2 basically went 'Let's do a pseudo-Final Fantasy/Zelda thing where each new game will take place somewhere different and feature different characters and stories'. It's almost completely been that way ever since sure the games had one or two characters return but they've changed the viruses, stories, and characters around to suit their needs.

1. Shin Megami Tensei series (Famicom, SNES, PS2, etc.) great spooky games with story-lines involving demons, end of the world scenarios and more than a few dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.

2. The Thing (PS2, XBOX) Game based off of the horror/thriller movie of the same name, it really got under my skin the last time I played it. Meant to give you a sense of you never know who you can trust, and I feel it does it pretty well.

3. The Suffering 1&2 (XBOX) Game where you are a prisoner on death row, when, right before your execution, all hell breaks loose. The great part about this game, to me, was the story it told through the environment and enemies. The island your stuck on has a truly screwed up history and they spare no details in explaining it to you. 

4. Silent Hill (PS1, PS2, Xbox, Wii, 360, PS3) This one is probably cheating, they are spooky, you have limited resources, OMG!

5. Majuu Ou - King of Demons (SNES) One I don't hear mentioned much, but it's a great SNES game with great music and game play that is a mix if Castlevania and Contra. It was a Super Famicom exclusive, but fan-translations exist out there so its easy to enjoy. 

6. Decap attack- A game made by Viktokai, all of whose games are pretty similar. This game those has some actual new elements. A great weird game. Game Grumps played it last Halloween, it was enjoyable to see as I grew up with that game on my Sega.

And That's all I can think of at the moment. I always work nights and will be working nights through Halloween, but thankfully its just answering phones, so if no one is calling I'll be playing spooky games. Enjoy and hope you saw a few new games in here!

558w5m,d8ahgwu,1,"Definetely Splatterhouse, the only reason anyone needs the PS3 version is to play the original games, it's the only way I know of to play the real arcade game and not the tg16 port, it also has ports of Splatterhouse 2 and 3 so it's a really good bargain considering how much physical copies of each game are going for. I would also reccomend Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti on the Famicom, it's  a fun Halloween game as well, it's more of a platformer than the other games, and it's more cutesy but still has some gore. You can't download it on any VC service but can easily be found on emulators and there are repro carts if you want to play it on your NES. I also highly encourage you to play Sweet Home, I own a repro of it and it's a fantastic game, it's so odd seeing such a dark game on the NES/Famicom. If you enjoy resident evil I would definetely reccomend checking out Silent Hill 1 and 2, they are some of the creepiest and most unsettling games I have ever played. Luigi's Mansion is a much more ""spooky"" game obviously, considering its part of the Mario franchise but it's still a really fun game to play around this time of year. Also for some movie reccomendations: I have become a real fan of the Evil Dead series, Evil Dead 2 in particular, it's the pinnacle of 80's horror movies in my opinion, it's low budget but done so right that I would consider it to be the greatest B horror movie of all time, the use of claymation and puppets is so awesome. Fun fact: Splatterhouse is full of nods to the movie, I won't spoil it for you but there are enemies that resemble characters in the movie and some of the plot seems to borrow from the movie as well. There's a documentary on Netflix about sleep paralysis that is absolutely terrifying, it's called the nightmare, it has people discuss their dreams and actors reinact them. ",1475386668.0

What are your favourite titles in the series? Care to rank them?",1675121352.0
10p3sac,j6kok31,3,"The only ones I've finished are 1, 8, 9, and 11.  I've dabbled in some of the others but they can be a little rough to go back to, very grindy and old-school in their design sensibilities.  Only finished 1 by following a guide step-by-step, and it was more ""interesting to see how it all started"" than super fun.  And they're so long, it's really easy to get distracted and put it down for a long time and then when you come back you're super lost.

I'd have a hard time choosing between 8 and 11 as my favorite.  8 is a little more straightforward mechanically, mostly what I like about it is how incredibly well-balanced it is.  At any given point, the challenge feels perfectly balanced such that I can probably squeak past a tough fight, or I could grind for fifteen minutes and level up enough to make it easy on myself.

&#x200B;

11 is a little more uneven balance-wise.  If you play on Normal difficulty, it's way too easy, to the point where it gets really boring.  If you play with the Stronger Monsters difficulty setting, it's close to being in line with the other games in the series overall, but it's WAY more difficult for the first ten hours or so, until you get a full party of four characters, and it has a couple of big difficulty spikes after that too.  On balance I like the Stronger Monsters difficulty way better because it forces you to engage with more of the game's systems in order to overcome the challenge, but there's no getting around the fact that those first ten hours or so are ROUGH.

&#x200B;

So 11's not quite as tightly balanced, but otoh I like the character-building mechanics more, and I like the story and world a little better too.

&#x200B;

9 would be a close third after 8 and 11, the story is only so-so, and the characters are generic blank slates.  Mechanically, though, it's fantastic, great implementation of the job system.  Visually it's held back by the fact that the DS hardware just isn't quite powerful enough to do everything the designers wanted it to so it winds up looking a little muddy.",1675124673.0
10p3sac,j6mtg8r,1,"8 is definitely my favourite in the series. I've heard great things about 11, and want to check it out, but it sounds like I should temper my expectations. I'm of a mind to replay 8 someday, given that it's been nearly twenty years now since I went through it on PS2. But then I remember the 80 hour main game, and another 10-20 hours for post-game content, and then I sigh and trudge back to my adult life.

Is the Miyoo Mini one of the handhelds in your collection? I [recently played Dragon Warrior IV for NES on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/107bb6a/finished_dragon_warrior_iv_what_a_captivating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and it was an incredible experience, top to bottom. Partly because I could suspend at any time, knowing the Mini's excellent firmware would power off and let me resume at the drop of a hat. I might go through Dragon Warrior III next, based on some recommendations from series die hards. But I can't imagine playing these on anything other than the most portable, convenient devices. The grinding in these older games is strangely relaxing, and the excellent soundtrack goes a long way to keeping you engaged.",1675171388.0

I'd rather spend that money on house renovations/remodel and my family.  While I could compromise my collection and sell off some of my games to afford it (per your suggestion), particular copies of the great games I have mean more to me than the ability to play the lesser ones in better quality.

I would LOVE a Framemeister with RGB in the future, but like I said, it isn't a priority at the moment.  Something like what u/star_jump suggested based off his own experience might to the trick.

...Or meet in the middle and get a Retron 5. Not as expensive as a Framemeister, but more expensive than a thrift store CRT. It'll play your classics and upscale them through HDMI perfectly, though you would be emulating at this point, which there's nothing wrong with.

/u/accaris suggested in the article I put up yesterday the DVDO iScan VP30. I don't have more info on it but he might. 

If you don't need a switch then just a simple HDMI box or upconverter might work, just know there might be lag, screen artifacting/glitching and it may not support certain consoles/sync types. That's why an upscaler is somewhat important because bad ones could render games basically unplayable not just un-pretty. 

Retron emulates but it can take cartridges from multiple machines and outputs HDMI. It can have issues with some games but it's no nonsense and the basics if you don't care about emulation. 


Computer route you could look into a RetroPie aka Raspberry Pi set up to run games. It's cheap, its basically a computer you just need a screen and to hook up the controllers. A friend of mine did this for a while and it worked really well and was portable.

Then came Game Boy and super Mario land - a game I still play to this day. 

Eventually it was N64 and of course, more Mario. A 3D world that I was just delighted to be able to make Mario run around and jump in. All I had was the grounds of the castle and Bob Omb Battlefield until a kid at school told me about the level boss and how beating him would let me play in other levels, through the paintings. The game just changed. No more simple left to right, you could go where you want and explore. 

I rarely truly enjoy newer games anymore sadly, I think, because this premise of freedom and exploration got taken to the Nth degree and it’s just too much for me, but for a time there was a world just big enough for me. That’s my story.

From a game design standpoint, LoZ is lacking in just about every area.  Cludgy control, grating sound effects, repetitive music, almost complete absence of story and characters, puzzles which amount to ""do random thing in random place based on no information or context to proceed"".  
  
It was an interesting *experiment* because this *absence of direction and signification* created a sense of exploration and discovery which felt new and remarkable.  But the power of that moment of *uncertainty* and *possibility* only goes so far.  At some point, one begins to play it as a *game* and not merely as an *experiential event*.  And at that moment, it becomes clear that the *game* elements of which it is constructed do not stand up particularly well, to the tests of time, or even to its better contemporaries.

Then we were introduced to camera angles that we had just started to see in arcades and games so massive they came out on systems more powerful and disc based.

Franchise wise I like almost anything but am curious about the gameplay, as many movies and such turned into games didn't always turn out well.

81239u,dv0l7m4,2,"A few thoughts about some of the games on the list:

Herc's Adventures is a humorous take on ancient Greek mythology. It plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors. I ended up enjoying Herc's Adventures more than Zombies, though. I feel it plays better, has genuinely funny humor, and more personality. I have the Saturn version.

In the Hunt is a fantastic underwater themed shmup from Irem. The player actually controls the pace of the game, and the screen does not scroll unless you move forward. It reminds me of a mix of R-Type and Metal Slug (members of the development team actually worked on both franchises). It's one of my favorite games of the era, and might be my favorite mid 90s shmup.

R-Types is self explanatory. If you like R-Type at all, this is a compilation of arcade-perfect ports of the first two games. You'll know whether you'll like it or not.

Similar situation for the Raiden Project. Arcade perfect ports of Raiden I and II. It's a launch title for the PS1.

Wild 9 was hyped at the time for being the brainchild of Shiny Entertainment, who was riding high after the Earthworm Jim games. It's a 2.5D action game with some sort of energy beam grappling hook gimmick, and a penchant for giving the player a lot of choices in terms of how to kill and torture your enemies. At the time, I felt disappointed comparing this game to Earthworm Jim, as it didn't have the personality or humor of that game. I actually haven't played it since that time, so I don't know if it has aged all that well.",1519914723.0

It gets old always having to put the shotgun away to be able to jump or not able to run if holding the gun. I felt the music was good but very repetitive. 

In the 32x version, the characters are all on steroids. Much bigger sprites than the SNES. You said it right when mentioning it's like Prince of Persia with a shotgun.

Garou: Mark Of The Wolves didn't come out until '99 - It wouldn't have been released on the SNES/SFC and Gen/MD anyways, and it definitely could have been ported to the SNES/SFC and Gen/MD, though (like with any of the other ports) it would have needed to be significantly cut down without extra hardware on the cart.

Also, the Saturn or PS1 are both technically more powerful than the NeoGeo, and likely could have ran MOTW fine, as there are plenty of examples of 2D games that are just as (if not, more) impressive on both systems.

That's the reason Metal Slug X ever came out...to make up for the mess that was MS2. So much slowdown regardless of you're playing on cartridge or CD. Not really fair to compare 2 on PS1 to the much better X on Saturn.

Saturn could have had a comperable port of Garou but it definitely would have needed the 4MB memory upgrade. A PS1 version would have been horribly butchered; the system was literally incapable of generating sprites. Any 2d game you see on PS1 is just polygons that are designed to look like sprites.

Herc's Adventures is a humorous take on ancient Greek mythology. It plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors. I ended up enjoying Herc's Adventures more than Zombies, though. I feel it plays better, has genuinely funny humor, and more personality. I have the Saturn version.

In the Hunt is a fantastic underwater themed shmup from Irem. The player actually controls the pace of the game, and the screen does not scroll unless you move forward. It reminds me of a mix of R-Type and Metal Slug (members of the development team actually worked on both franchises). It's one of my favorite games of the era, and might be my favorite mid 90s shmup.

R-Types is self explanatory. If you like R-Type at all, this is a compilation of arcade-perfect ports of the first two games. You'll know whether you'll like it or not.

Similar situation for the Raiden Project. Arcade perfect ports of Raiden I and II. It's a launch title for the PS1.

Wild 9 was hyped at the time for being the brainchild of Shiny Entertainment, who was riding high after the Earthworm Jim games. It's a 2.5D action game with some sort of energy beam grappling hook gimmick, and a penchant for giving the player a lot of choices in terms of how to kill and torture your enemies.

Also, the Saturn or PS1 are both technically more powerful than the NeoGeo, and likely could have ran MOTW fine, as there are plenty of examples of 2D games that are just as (if not, more) impressive on both systems.

Not really fair to compare 2 on PS1 to the much better X on Saturn.

Saturn could have had a comperable port of Garou but it definitely would have needed the 4MB memory upgrade.

I've always wanted to complete Dragon quest 7, by the time it was finally released in the US, I was well into adulting & didn't have alot of time for gaming any longer. I've started it maybe a half dozen times & never got more then 1/4 into it, if that! I think the furthest I've gotten, was where you start getting jobs / classes for your characters.

10p3sac,j6kgpb7,1,"I feel like I’ve seen you around these parts for months, and never even realized you were a Dragon Quest fan. I’ve slowly been going back through the series - I don’t know nearly as much as I should, especially compared to Final Fantasy.

What are your favourite titles in the series? Care to rank them?",1675121352.0
10p3sac,j6kok31,3,"The only ones I've finished are 1, 8, 9, and 11.  I've dabbled in some of the others but they can be a little rough to go back to, very grindy and old-school in their design sensibilities.  Only finished 1 by following a guide step-by-step, and it was more ""interesting to see how it all started"" than super fun.  And they're so long, it's really easy to get distracted and put it down for a long time and then when you come back you're super lost.

I'd have a hard time choosing between 8 and 11 as my favorite.  8 is a little more straightforward mechanically, mostly what I like about it is how incredibly well-balanced it is.  At any given point, the challenge feels perfectly balanced such that I can probably squeak past a tough fight, or I could grind for fifteen minutes and level up enough to make it easy on myself.

&#x200B;

11 is a little more uneven balance-wise.  If you play on Normal difficulty, it's way too easy, to the point where it gets really boring.  If you play with the Stronger Monsters difficulty setting, it's close to being in line with the other games in the series overall, but it's WAY more difficult for the first ten hours or so, until you get a full party of four characters, and it has a couple of big difficulty spikes after that too.  On balance I like the Stronger Monsters difficulty way better because it forces you to engage with more of the game's systems in order to overcome the challenge, but there's no getting around the fact that those first ten hours or so are ROUGH.

&#x200B;

So 11's not quite as tightly balanced, but otoh I like the character-building mechanics more, and I like the story and world a little better too.

&#x200B;

9 would be a close third after 8 and 11, the story is only so-so, and the characters are generic blank slates.  Mechanically, though, it's fantastic, great implementation of the job system.  Visually it's held back by the fact that the DS hardware just isn't quite powerful enough to do everything the designers wanted it to so it winds up looking a little muddy.",1675124673.0
10p3sac,j6mtg8r,1,"8 is definitely my favourite in the series. I've heard great things about 11, and want to check it out, but it sounds like I should temper my expectations. I'm of a mind to replay 8 someday, given that it's been nearly twenty years now since I went through it on PS2. But then I remember the 80 hour main game, and another 10-20 hours for post-game content, and then I sigh and trudge back to my adult life.

Is the Miyoo Mini one of the handhelds in your collection? I [recently played Dragon Warrior IV for NES on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/107bb6a/finished_dragon_warrior_iv_what_a_captivating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and it was an incredible experience, top to bottom. Partly because I could suspend at any time, knowing the Mini's excellent firmware would power off and let me resume at the drop of a hat. I might go through Dragon Warrior III next, based on some recommendations from series die hards. But I can't imagine playing these on anything other than the most portable, convenient devices. The grinding in these older games is strangely relaxing, and the excellent soundtrack goes a long way to keeping you engaged.",1675171388.0

As a little kid I had a Sega Master System and loved it; Sonic was perfect for 5/6 year old me - bright, colourful, exciting and importantly: linear.  Left to right, quickly - until the end of the level. 

Then came Game Boy and super Mario land - a game I still play to this day. 

Eventually it was N64 and of course, more Mario. A 3D world that I was just delighted to be able to make Mario run around and jump in. All I had was the grounds of the castle and Bob Omb Battlefield until a kid at school told me about the level boss and how beating him would let me play in other levels, through the paintings. The game just changed. No more simple left to right, you could go where you want and explore. 

I rarely truly enjoy newer games anymore sadly, I think, because this premise of freedom and exploration got taken to the Nth degree and it’s just too much for me, but for a time there was a world just big enough for me. That’s my story.

3kl3y2,cuymkig,2,"Be sure to check out [Grand Master](https://youtu.be/rPp9xGzTsyk) for the Famicom.  It's really light on the RPG elements.  It just has a few upgrades for you to find, and you have to figure out the best order to tackle the 5 stages.  It's difficult enough that you don't breeze through it, but not so hard that it sucks to play.  The music's good.  You don't even need to translate it to play it, but there is definitely an English patch for it.  A friend of mine would always describe Crystalis as Zelda 1.5 .  If that's the case, then Grand Master is Zelda 1.25, though it came out after Crystalis.

Another lesser-known Japanese game you might like is [Ai Senshi Nicol](https://youtu.be/_EzTsujCWes?t=1m14s).  It's like The Guardian Legend without the shooter segments, or perhaps like a sci-fi Legend of Zelda.  I recommend playing the FDS version, not the Famicom version, because the extra sound channels of the FDS add a lot to this game.  You don't need to translate this one either, though an English patch is pretty easy to find.

I didn't beat a version of RE1 (REmake) myself until this year, and I beat RE2 almost ten years ago. RE2 was designed in the early days when the series had no true definitive continuity. The devs of RE2 basically went 'Let's do a pseudo-Final Fantasy/Zelda thing where each new game will take place somewhere different and feature different characters and stories'. It's almost completely been that way ever since sure the games had one or two characters return but they've changed the viruses, stories, and characters around to suit their needs.

4drxqp,d1twf7x,5,"The best Final Fantasy is usually the first one you played :)

My favorites are FF V, VI, and VII, not necessarily in that order. FF V was the first one I played, borrowed from a friend on the Super Famicom. The music and presentation blew me away, and then there was the craziness that was the job system. You get overpowered later on provided you did some smart grinding but still :)

FF VI was the next one I played and it bumped the presentation, story and music to the next level was a really enjoyable experience.

FF VII was the reason why I bought a Playstation. The cinematics and the overall feel really screamed - ""This is what CDs can do! 4 CDs!"" The story had heart and a real emotional draw to it, and had likable characters. I had some reservations about the futuristic feel to it, but it worked quite well.

Was really disappointed by FF VIII, from the moment I played the demo that was on Brave Fencer Musashiden. It felt so sterile and the magic draw system?? Whaaaat?? You want me to sit there and keep drawing magic from mobs, til I get 100?

FF IX was a throwback to the 'classic' Final Fantasy and that got me excited but I still could not get into the game. It looked great, but for some reason it didn't come together for me.

FF X, I actually enjoyed and actually finished it. But I think this is where the series started going down the path of running through hallways though.

FF XII I bought but lost interest with all the political mumbo jumbo and names. The combat was real time, which was actually pretty nice but I got stuck at some big robot bulldozer boss and didn't want to grind.

FF XIII I bought from the bargain bin at GameStop for $9 on the Xbox 360. The opening cinematic was just..wtf? And the tutorials, the hallways, the generic characters, the fal-cie? Wow..

So everything beyond FFVII is non-classic, forgettable heartless affairs - to me, at least :)

I'm not even looking forward to the FFVII remake - I feel like all remakes do pretty up the graphics, but so much soul of what made the game gets lost in the process.",1460055185.0

Seriously, though, probably 6, though I've never beaten it. Got halfway through when my cousin erased my savegame, and was in no mood to put those ~30 hours or whatever back in. I don't remember how long exactly (it seemed like forever), but I know that I'm a slow player, and this was pre-Internet, so you didn't have any walkthroughs or guides to help you unless you bought a book or magazine (which I didn't have). It was borrowed, so I just returned it rather than going through all that again. I've played it a bit a few times since, but never got as far as I did that first time.

Now that I think about it, though, Mystic Quest might actually be the only Final Fantasy that I'm sure I've beaten.

The game is basically...you need object A to unlock gate B. Grind until you can battle for A. Repeat 15 times.  

Now I also tried and finished the Android/IOS FF1 release. It's fixes problems like the walking speed and adds MP points. It scratched an itch...meh.

I love listening to game music, but this is one I would actually love to own.  It's just that good.

VII, though, was the first PS game I ever saw, and I can still remember my reaction to seeing the realistic opening with the train barreling down the track.  I remember showing my mom, ""Look at how real it looks!!!""  And, again, a fantastic soundtrack with well developed characters.
Both games have fantastic villains, though.  Sephiroth is a fantastic bad guy, but I'd have to give my money to Kefka for being one of the worst villains in all of video game history.

4drxqp,d1wdrbp,2,"My brother made fun of me for over a decade for my passion for FF. Then when he saw the demo for XV and the stuff for VII remake, he asked me a similar question. Here is how I basically laid it out.

VI may be the best game to start with, as long as you don't mind old visuals from the 16 bit era. If you have to play with newer graphics, start with X. Just know, that X was a transition point for the series. You may not develop an appreciation for the older stuff. Here are a quick synopsis of most of the games. But really, except for for I, XII, XIII and II, you could start with any of the rest of them and really enjoy yourself.

VII hasnt aged well. Unless you played it when you were younger, it may be difficult to get through. (Its really freaking good though)

VIII is good. People have hate for it, and the draw system. But the story is interesting and involved, and the card game and fighting mechanics are enjoyable for the person who likes to grind. 

IX is really best played after you have tackled a few of the earlier games. Play 1,4,6,7 before 9. But you don't have to. It was sort of the swan song to what Final Fantasy had been. A great game that was a thank you to the fans who had supported the series for so long. My personal ""best"" FF game.

X is exceptional.  VI is great. II is difficult for green RPGers, you need to have a lot of resolve for that battle system. IV is a dream for grinders. XII shouldn't have been a FF game, it would be viewed more favorably if it had been part of its own or another series. But it is a decent RPG that borrow from its MMO brethren plenty.

81239u,dv0l7m4,2,"A few thoughts about some of the games on the list:

Herc's Adventures is a humorous take on ancient Greek mythology. It plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors. I ended up enjoying Herc's Adventures more than Zombies, though. I feel it plays better, has genuinely funny humor, and more personality. I have the Saturn version.

In the Hunt is a fantastic underwater themed shmup from Irem. The player actually controls the pace of the game, and the screen does not scroll unless you move forward. It reminds me of a mix of R-Type and Metal Slug (members of the development team actually worked on both franchises). It's one of my favorite games of the era, and might be my favorite mid 90s shmup.

R-Types is self explanatory. If you like R-Type at all, this is a compilation of arcade-perfect ports of the first two games. You'll know whether you'll like it or not.

Similar situation for the Raiden Project. Arcade perfect ports of Raiden I and II. It's a launch title for the PS1.

Wild 9 was hyped at the time for being the brainchild of Shiny Entertainment, who was riding high after the Earthworm Jim games. It's a 2.5D action game with some sort of energy beam grappling hook gimmick, and a penchant for giving the player a lot of choices in terms of how to kill and torture your enemies. At the time, I felt disappointed comparing this game to Earthworm Jim, as it didn't have the personality or humor of that game. I actually haven't played it since that time, so I don't know if it has aged all that well.",1519914723.0

jmsw2s,gay99t5,1,"The problem is really that ""Action Adventure"" is very broad. This is primarily because the term comes from a time where games were much simpler and and elements that defined the genres of action and adventure historically are basic enough mechanics that they're found in a *lot* of games today.

Adventure games traditionally were games that focused on exploring an environment and solving situational puzzles and problems.

Action games were traditionally games that focused on real time interactions, especially combat.

The thing is that despite being *very* different games, Uncharted and Zelda do both fit both descriptions, although with Uncharted leaning more towards a pure action game, with Zelda being more of a balance, depending on which game we're talking about.

As I said before, the ideas of video game genres come from a time when games were much simpler. The purpose of genres is to categorize games such that their mechanics can easily be described very concisely. This allows someone to get a lot of information on what a game is and how much it will conform to their tastes without actually playing it, or spending time researching it. Now that we see games that are complex enough that they fit the definitions of several traditional genres, in a lot of cases you can't really easily describe their mechanics with just one traditonal game genre.

We're kind of left with two solutions here with neither being mutually exclusive. The first is that we can describe games using combinations of genres. Action adventure is really just an early example of this. With the added complexity of action adventure games we see now though, it's just not very useful anymore because the genre has diverged enough that it's too broad on its own. If you stick just with this method, you end up with less concise descriptions of games that often would include too many genres to really be all that descriptive of the game's focus.

The other major option is using aliases to describe games with similar mechanics that may fit into several traditional genres. Some of the more common ones we see these days are ""Metroidvania"", ""Rogue Like"", and ""Souls Like"". Regardless of how you feel about those terms (as I know they are controversial), they do a decent job at least of allowing us to group games together, this time based on them being similar to influential games.

While some traditional genres are still useful (racing, sports, etc.) others aren't so much because they've become too broad and not descriptive enough. Because of this, it's often useful to go beyond the traditional game genres to describe games in the concise manner that the traditional genres used to.

Personally I'd probably describe the Zelda series overall as action adventure games with the progression mechanics of what are often referred to as metroidvania games. I don't have as much experience with Uncharted.",1604361039.0

jmsw2s,gaxdorx,2,"> I feel it's and adventure game the same way Indiana Jones is is an adventure movie.

Not really comparable for historical reasons. Game genres have their own meanings.

""Adventure"" as a *game* genre actually has nothing to do with what you do in the game, and everything to do with the fact that the originator of the genre was called *Colossal Cave Adventure*, which was often just abbreviated to ""Adventure"". It's similar to ""Roguelike"" or ""Metroidvania"" in that regard.

The ""Action Adventure"" genre by extension is the genre of games that have evolved from Atari's *Adventure*, which was a game created as an attempt to recreate the original *Colossal Cave Adventure* as a graphical action game on the Atari 2600.

Similarly, when someone says a game is a ""Role-Playing Game"", they mean that it has evolved from the early attempts at adapting tabletop RPGs like *Dungeons & Dragons* to video game form (such as *Wizardry* and *Ultima*). Just because you play a role in a game does not make it an RPG, otherwise almost every game would be one. A genre is more than just the meaning of the words in the name.",1604345304.0
jmsw2s,gaxdces,1,I think of action-adventure as different than classic point n click adventure games. Even the what I classify as adventure elements in these games I think of as separate from point n clicks. I totally see what you're saying though.,1604345148.0
jmsw2s,gaxegip,2,"Sure, ""Action Adventure"" is the genre of games that evolved from Atari's *Adventure*, which was itself an attempt to adapt *Colossal Cave Adventure*, which is the game that traditional Adventure games themselves evolved from. They're related genres that came about as a result of divergent evolution.

Similarly, Adventure games and RPGs both are arguably divergent attempts to adapt Dungeons & Dragons to video game form, but with a focus on adapting different aspects of the game. As such, they are themselves a divergent evolution of the same concept.

The reality is, we're talking about very broad genre categories here, and more specific granularity is for what subgenres are. Metroidvanias are a subgenre of Action Adventure, and Roguelikes are a subgenre of RPG. Saying a game is an ""Adventure"" is kind of like saying an animal is a ""mammal"". You start broad, and then define more specific from there.",1604345668.0

As a little kid I had a Sega Master System and loved it; Sonic was perfect for 5/6 year old me - bright, colourful, exciting and importantly: linear.  Left to right, quickly - until the end of the level. 

Then came Game Boy and super Mario land - a game I still play to this day. 

Eventually it was N64 and of course, more Mario. A 3D world that I was just delighted to be able to make Mario run around and jump in. All I had was the grounds of the castle and Bob Omb Battlefield until a kid at school told me about the level boss and how beating him would let me play in other levels, through the paintings. The game just changed. No more simple left to right, you could go where you want and explore. 

I rarely truly enjoy newer games anymore sadly, I think, because this premise of freedom and exploration got taken to the Nth degree and it’s just too much for me, but for a time there was a world just big enough for me. That’s my story.

Amazing game. Incredible level design. 
How that game has been almost completely forgotten is beyond me.

Another one is Simpsons on the Nintendo DS, I wouldn't call it a favourite by any means but I enjoyed it a lot. Mentioning this one mostly because it got some pretty mediocre reviews back when it first came out but I've always felt it was a really good game. Could be an outlier here though as like I said, this one didn't go over particularly well in reviews of the era.

Pitfall on the SNES is a lot of fun. Gets a bit of a bad reputation for being confusing to navigate but I appreciate it. Levels with a few different routes is pretty unique for the time. Bosses are pretty crappy however. Still, one of the better platformers on a system with a lot of great platformers.

Adventure: an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity. To be honest, ""Adventure"" should not be it's own thing, but a subgenre. For example, Puzzle Adventure vs Action Adventure vs Racing Adventure a la Need For Speed The Run",1604382025.0

I don't like when there are too many genre names for games because it gets to be too much, the same thing with music genres since there are so many sub-genres. I like to label something in its general genre with ""tags"" for each one giving a little more explanation.

RPG (Tactical, Japanese, western, turn based, action, etc...) or Metal (heavy, death, hair, etc...)",1604341605.0

jmsw2s,gay99t5,1,"The problem is really that ""Action Adventure"" is very broad. This is primarily because the term comes from a time where games were much simpler and and elements that defined the genres of action and adventure historically are basic enough mechanics that they're found in a *lot* of games today.

Adventure games traditionally were games that focused on exploring an environment and solving situational puzzles and problems.

Action games were traditionally games that focused on real time interactions, especially combat.

The thing is that despite being *very* different games, Uncharted and Zelda do both fit both descriptions, although with Uncharted leaning more towards a pure action game, with Zelda being more of a balance, depending on which game we're talking about.

As I said before, the ideas of video game genres come from a time when games were much simpler. The purpose of genres is to categorize games such that their mechanics can easily be described very concisely. This allows someone to get a lot of information on what a game is and how much it will conform to their tastes without actually playing it, or spending time researching it. Now that we see games that are complex enough that they fit the definitions of several traditional genres, in a lot of cases you can't really easily describe their mechanics with just one traditonal game genre.

We're kind of left with two solutions here with neither being mutually exclusive. The first is that we can describe games using combinations of genres. Action adventure is really just an early example of this. With the added complexity of action adventure games we see now though, it's just not very useful anymore because the genre has diverged enough that it's too broad on its own. If you stick just with this method, you end up with less concise descriptions of games that often would include too many genres to really be all that descriptive of the game's focus.

The other major option is using aliases to describe games with similar mechanics that may fit into several traditional genres. Some of the more common ones we see these days are ""Metroidvania"", ""Rogue Like"", and ""Souls Like"". Regardless of how you feel about those terms (as I know they are controversial), they do a decent job at least of allowing us to group games together, this time based on them being similar to influential games.

While some traditional genres are still useful (racing, sports, etc.) others aren't so much because they've become too broad and not descriptive enough. Because of this, it's often useful to go beyond the traditional game genres to describe games in the concise manner that the traditional genres used to.

Personally I'd probably describe the Zelda series overall as action adventure games with the progression mechanics of what are often referred to as metroidvania games. I don't have as much experience with Uncharted.",1604361039.0

jmsw2s,gaxdorx,2,"> I feel it's and adventure game the same way Indiana Jones is is an adventure movie.

Not really comparable for historical reasons. Game genres have their own meanings.

""Adventure"" as a *game* genre actually has nothing to do with what you do in the game, and everything to do with the fact that the originator of the genre was called *Colossal Cave Adventure*, which was often just abbreviated to ""Adventure"". It's similar to ""Roguelike"" or ""Metroidvania"" in that regard.

The ""Action Adventure"" genre by extension is the genre of games that have evolved from Atari's *Adventure*, which was a game created as an attempt to recreate the original *Colossal Cave Adventure* as a graphical action game on the Atari 2600.

Similarly, when someone says a game is a ""Role-Playing Game"", they mean that it has evolved from the early attempts at adapting tabletop RPGs like *Dungeons & Dragons* to video game form (such as *Wizardry* and *Ultima*). Just because you play a role in a game does not make it an RPG, otherwise almost every game would be one. A genre is more than just the meaning of the words in the name.",1604345304.0
jmsw2s,gaxdces,1,I think of action-adventure as different than classic point n click adventure games. Even the what I classify as adventure elements in these games I think of as separate from point n clicks. I totally see what you're saying though.,1604345148.0
jmsw2s,gaxegip,2,"Sure, ""Action Adventure"" is the genre of games that evolved from Atari's *Adventure*, which was itself an attempt to adapt *Colossal Cave Adventure*, which is the game that traditional Adventure games themselves evolved from. They're related genres that came about as a result of divergent evolution.

Similarly, Adventure games and RPGs both are arguably divergent attempts to adapt Dungeons & Dragons to video game form, but with a focus on adapting different aspects of the game. As such, they are themselves a divergent evolution of the same concept.

The reality is, we're talking about very broad genre categories here, and more specific granularity is for what subgenres are. Metroidvanias are a subgenre of Action Adventure, and Roguelikes are a subgenre of RPG. Saying a game is an ""Adventure"" is kind of like saying an animal is a ""mammal"". You start broad, and then define more specific from there.",1604345668.0

The genesis does too but I will say a good chunk did not get played by a majority of people. I can only assume people walked through there local video store (we can all recall our local one from our childhood) and just mearly glanced over the genesis library. Meanwhile they ended up mainly looking through the SNES library at games to rent for the most part. Which is totally fine and ill admit some of the titles I did not grow a fondness for until I was able to download emulators and just kind of messed around with recommendations. Now I am not saying that you should change your outlook immediately. If you dont have a feel for the system then thats totally fine. We all have our own taste's in things and no one can change that. I will say take a game you have heard good things about on the system and give it a shot. You never know it just might suprise you. I never cared to play the Splatterhouse series growing up. Now that I have grown and am a huge horror fan I decided to give them a fair shot. Now its one of my favorite series. Didn't care to play Gunstar Hero's either but I ended up trying it out years later and I completely love the game. Easily on par with Contra 3 which is a game I grew up playing.
",1441435835.0
3jn9bq,cure6w9,2,"The Genesis was my only 16-bit console for the majority of that era, so I played nothing but Genesis games for years.  I was the guy in my group of friends claiming that the Genesis was the superior console while everyone else I knew was busy playing SNES games.  I even saved up hard-earned paper route money for more than half a year to buy a Sega CD, which I played the hell out of.  I know there are a decent number of good Genesis games, and I played almost all of them back when they were relevant.  I'd even go so far as to say that I have more nostalgia for the Genesis and Sega CD than I do for the SNES.  I even remember doing things like recording the soundtracks of Genesis games onto audio cassettes so I could listen to them on my mom's Walkman during family road trips.  I just think the console had a much weaker library, and I see no shame in admitting that.  I still play my Genesis from time to time and enjoy doing so, but none of the games I've played on it have left the same sort of lasting impression on me that many SNES games did when I finally ended up buying one around the time the Playstation was released.  When I finally got a chance to play games like Super Mario World, A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, Earthbound, Actraiser... it would honestly be a very long list, but I was actually mad at myself for ignoring the SNES for so long; even at the time I could tell that the games which were available for it were all much better than any of the games I had been playing up to that point.  I wish I could say that I just haven't given Genesis games a fair shot or that I merely overlooked the great games that were available for the console, but I just genuinely liked what it had to offer less and my opinion hasn't changed much over the years.  If anything, the advent of emulators only helped to solidify that opinion, as it made me much more aware of the gap in quality between the libraries of both consoles; I had the opportunity to experience and compare them in their entirety where no such opportunity had existed before.",1441447756.0
3jn9bq,curcgo6,1,"My two cents:

During the 16-bit war, the SNES and Genesis were obviously fairly close in terms of popularity (that's why it was called a war).

The people who make up the retro-gaming community today, who were also around for the 16 bit wars, are mostly SNES kids.  They tend to really like RPG's.

There are much fewer Genesis kids involved in the retro gaming world.  Maybe they really liked sports games, or arcade style games (that's why they favored the Genesis), and weren't into RPG's.  They've mostly moved on.  Maybe they're not even into gaming anymore, or maybe the retro thing doesn't appeal to them because the kinds of gaming experience they're looking for, can also be had on newer systems.

So in short, things are skewed.  SNES gets a disproportionately large amount of 'love', because the only people left to talk about these things, are the nerdy SNES kids with their RPG's. ",1441439405.0

lrvsrh,goocrgh,3,"The ""more powerful"" argument comes down to two things in my opinion.

1) More colors, like you said. It's just hard to get away from this one, but Nintendo had 2 extra years to develop the hardware.

2) Development teams.  Nintendo was the company that saved the game market and had an iron fist on 3rd parties in the 8-bit era, which hurt the Master System.  Nobody wanted to upset them so Sega often got the B Team porting to their hardware. This happened with Street Fighter II, but Capcom wasn't happy with the quality and brought development in house.

You have to remember that the port we got on a given system wasn't necessarily the best the hardware could do, it was just good enough. Games were often scaled back more than they needed to be to reduce cost on the size of the ROM needed.  The most obvious example being the N64 MKT beta ROMS showing higher resolution sprites and more frames of animation, cut back so it could fit on a 96 Mb cart.

Another example; someone has ported a few levels of Mega Man X to the Genesis. It looks great and sounds great, but Capcom didn't want to bother.

They're both great systems with pluses and minuses, but the Genesis got the short end of the stick more than it deserved.",1614231967.0

lrvsrh,h3io9dz,2,"If you look at the raw system specs, the SNES can easily throw more sprites on the screen.

But there's a problem: it can only access the VRAM during a Vblank. And it can only set two sprite tile sizes at a time. And it's sprite look-up tables are a mess that can take twice as many passes for a large sprite.  

And there's complications involving slow 3rd party ROM carts that boot the cpu into a slower compatibility mode. 

And did I mention you're limited to just 16k to control your playfield at a time?

And this is me dumbing things down, because I have no idea what the DMA, HDMA, and the WRAM address bus can do.

3jn9bq,curbl6y,2,"You know I think it finally hit me why people have that attitude. Not to say the SNES doesnt have an endless number of great games because it clearly does. The genesis does too but I will say a good chunk did not get played by a majority of people. I can only assume people walked through there local video store (we can all recall our local one from our childhood) and just mearly glanced over the genesis library. Meanwhile they ended up mainly looking through the SNES library at games to rent for the most part. Which is totally fine and ill admit some of the titles I did not grow a fondness for until I was able to download emulators and just kind of messed around with recommendations. Now I am not saying that you should change your outlook immediately. If you dont have a feel for the system then thats totally fine. We all have our own taste's in things and no one can change that. I will say take a game you have heard good things about on the system and give it a shot. You never know it just might suprise you. I never cared to play the Splatterhouse series growing up. Now that I have grown and am a huge horror fan I decided to give them a fair shot. Now its one of my favorite series. Didn't care to play Gunstar Hero's either but I ended up trying it out years later and I completely love the game. Easily on par with Contra 3 which is a game I grew up playing.
",1441435835.0
3jn9bq,cure6w9,2,"The Genesis was my only 16-bit console for the majority of that era, so I played nothing but Genesis games for years.  I was the guy in my group of friends claiming that the Genesis was the superior console while everyone else I knew was busy playing SNES games.  I even saved up hard-earned paper route money for more than half a year to buy a Sega CD, which I played the hell out of.  I know there are a decent number of good Genesis games, and I played almost all of them back when they were relevant.  I'd even go so far as to say that I have more nostalgia for the Genesis and Sega CD than I do for the SNES.  I even remember doing things like recording the soundtracks of Genesis games onto audio cassettes so I could listen to them on my mom's Walkman during family road trips.  I just think the console had a much weaker library, and I see no shame in admitting that.  I still play my Genesis from time to time and enjoy doing so, but none of the games I've played on it have left the same sort of lasting impression on me that many SNES games did when I finally ended up buying one around the time the Playstation was released.  When I finally got a chance to play games like Super Mario World, A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, Earthbound, Actraiser... it would honestly be a very long list, but I was actually mad at myself for ignoring the SNES for so long; even at the time I could tell that the games which were available for it were all much better than any of the games I had been playing up to that point.  I wish I could say that I just haven't given Genesis games a fair shot or that I merely overlooked the great games that were available for the console, but I just genuinely liked what it had to offer less and my opinion hasn't changed much over the years.  If anything, the advent of emulators only helped to solidify that opinion, as it made me much more aware of the gap in quality between the libraries of both consoles; I had the opportunity to experience and compare them in their entirety where no such opportunity had existed before.",1441447756.0
3jn9bq,curcgo6,1,"My two cents:

During the 16-bit war, the SNES and Genesis were obviously fairly close in terms of popularity (that's why it was called a war).

The people who make up the retro-gaming community today, who were also around for the 16 bit wars, are mostly SNES kids.  They tend to really like RPG's.

There are much fewer Genesis kids involved in the retro gaming world.  Maybe they really liked sports games, or arcade style games (that's why they favored the Genesis), and weren't into RPG's.  They've mostly moved on.  Maybe they're not even into gaming anymore, or maybe the retro thing doesn't appeal to them because the kinds of gaming experience they're looking for, can also be had on newer systems.

So in short, things are skewed.  SNES gets a disproportionately large amount of 'love', because the only people left to talk about these things, are the nerdy SNES kids with their RPG's. ",1441439405.0

1. Shin Megami Tensei series (Famicom, SNES, PS2, etc.) great spooky games with story-lines involving demons, end of the world scenarios and more than a few dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.

2. The Thing (PS2, XBOX) Game based off of the horror/thriller movie of the same name, it really got under my skin the last time I played it. Meant to give you a sense of you never know who you can trust, and I feel it does it pretty well.

3. The Suffering 1&2 (XBOX) Game where you are a prisoner on death row, when, right before your execution, all hell breaks loose. The great part about this game, to me, was the story it told through the environment and enemies. The island your stuck on has a truly screwed up history and they spare no details in explaining it to you. 

4. Silent Hill (PS1, PS2, Xbox, Wii, 360, PS3) This one is probably cheating, they are spooky, you have limited resources, OMG!

5. Majuu Ou - King of Demons (SNES) One I don't hear mentioned much, but it's a great SNES game with great music and game play that is a mix if Castlevania and Contra. It was a Super Famicom exclusive, but fan-translations exist out there so its easy to enjoy. 

6. Decap attack- A game made by Viktokai, all of whose games are pretty similar. This game those has some actual new elements. A great weird game. Game Grumps played it last Halloween, it was enjoyable to see as I grew up with that game on my Sega.

And That's all I can think of at the moment. I always work nights and will be working nights through Halloween, but thankfully its just answering phones, so if no one is calling I'll be playing spooky games. Enjoy and hope you saw a few new games in here!

558w5m,d8ahgwu,1,"Definetely Splatterhouse, the only reason anyone needs the PS3 version is to play the original games, it's the only way I know of to play the real arcade game and not the tg16 port, it also has ports of Splatterhouse 2 and 3 so it's a really good bargain considering how much physical copies of each game are going for. I would also reccomend Splatterhouse Wanpaku Graffiti on the Famicom, it's  a fun Halloween game as well, it's more of a platformer than the other games, and it's more cutesy but still has some gore. You can't download it on any VC service but can easily be found on emulators and there are repro carts if you want to play it on your NES. I also highly encourage you to play Sweet Home, I own a repro of it and it's a fantastic game, it's so odd seeing such a dark game on the NES/Famicom. If you enjoy resident evil I would definetely reccomend checking out Silent Hill 1 and 2, they are some of the creepiest and most unsettling games I have ever played. Luigi's Mansion is a much more ""spooky"" game obviously, considering its part of the Mario franchise but it's still a really fun game to play around this time of year. Also for some movie reccomendations: I have become a real fan of the Evil Dead series, Evil Dead 2 in particular, it's the pinnacle of 80's horror movies in my opinion, it's low budget but done so right that I would consider it to be the greatest B horror movie of all time, the use of claymation and puppets is so awesome. Fun fact: Splatterhouse is full of nods to the movie, I won't spoil it for you but there are enemies that resemble characters in the movie and some of the plot seems to borrow from the movie as well. There's a documentary on Netflix about sleep paralysis that is absolutely terrifying, it's called the nightmare, it has people discuss their dreams and actors reinact them. ",1475386668.0

It's not a conversion ether. See that zone? Doesn't exist on the Genesis. Neither does the next one, either. There's a lot of that, because it's a completely different game by a different developer that was developed and released AT THE EXACT SAME TIME AS THE GENESIS GAME. 

I shouldn't have to repeat that. 

So I'm still nominating Sonic the Hedgehog for 8-bit.

That can be a really good time if the server is maintained well and the staff seems to be dedicated to this server so good on them. There are several main eras of UO that are replicated across many public servers like this: T2A (very vanilla, most limited options, what most people consider the golden era), UO Renaissance (beginning of the end but still some solid gameplay, a bit more variety than T2a) and AOS (closer to modern UO with lots of anti-griefing, care bear elements, most of the risk v reward is gone, etc).

pkt7m8,hc6cqcc,4,"The 1983-1986 era was absolutely rife with single and multi-screen platformers.  Many of them were developed for a wide array of platforms.  Many were from the first generation of big arcade action hits which were *never actually released in arcades*.  Examples of very popular titles include:  
  
- Popeye (Nintendo - arcade and various platforms)  
- Pitfall! (Activision - 2600 and various others)  
- Jumpman Junior (Epyx - various platforms)  
- Lode Runner (Broderbund - various platforms)  
- Burgertime (Data East - arcade and various platforms)  
  
Many games of this era were cloned wantonly.  And sometimes, ""official"" ports are hugely inaccurate or awful, while sometimes unofficial clones are excellent.  So there is often less so a clear body of, say, five ""official versions"" of a hit platformer, as there are *many dozens* of official and licensed and unofficial versions and ports and clones, of widely varying relevance to the original.  For example, it is left as an exercise to the reader to decide whether ""Junkman Junior"" for TI-99 (which is an unofficial clone, but very accurate) counts as a version of Jumpman Junior, or whether Congo Bongo for 2600 (which is an official version, but very inaccurate) counts as a version of Congo Bongo.",1631192204.0

When this game hit, it defined the state of the art. So demanding that even the PC Engine conversion had to be split into two carts, it signaled the beginning of the end of the Famicom's domination. 

The other home ports were just as impressive, from shmup masters Compile on the Master System, to the Spectrum port being so far above the competition in avoiding the dreaded color clash that two different publishers threatened to sue the programmer if he gave it to anyone else. 

Meanwhile, the C64 port was handed to the same pirates who tried making an illegal clone. Unlike most pirates, these were some of the best coders in the world.

The actual level design is mostly bad to non-existent, but it’s more than made up by the fully customizable move set, way, way over-the-top specials, bizarre bosses and goofy, bizarre story. 

The difficulty setting was also totally unique in that if you took no hits, the difficulty kept ramping up until you were hit, then it dropped back down a notch. This happens dynamically as you play. 


Double dash on the joystick causes you to sprint (just like in a hundred other games) but instead of using a running animation your guy just speeds forward with the walking animation at 3X.  One of the specials involves putting the enemy over your knee and mashing X to spank them. There’s Chihuahua races.  You fight 2 huge buff effeminate dudes and later dwarves dressed like Power Rangers complete with catch phrases and combo attacks.

But games like Garou Mark of the Wolves, Last Blade or indeed some of the Samurai Showdown games SNK were on top of their game.

eoxy4f,fegk105,2,"Yeah, I got bitten by the collecting bug at about this exact time last year. Very badly.

After years of emulating I decided I wanted to get a real Atari 2600 heavy sixer, because this was the first console I played as a child (not including a pong TV game).

Then I started collecting the games (boxed). Then I got a 14"" CRT (Sony Trinitron) to play it on.

Then I bought a ZX Spectrum 128k +2 and some games. The Spectrum was the only 8-bit we had, and we went through virtually every iteration, from a 16k to the 128k +2.

Then I got an Ingersol Pong TV game (similar to the one I had before the Atari), which are quite plentiful on ebay. Then I bought an old black & white CRT just for the TV game to run on (that was surprisingly harder to come by).

Then I think I started on the handhelds. Original Game Boy. Game Boy advance. Original DS. A DS Lite. A PSP.

Then came a SNES (and games), then an original PSX, then a Vectrex (the most expensive purchase so far), then a PS2, then a PS3 (for which I already had games packed away). With the exception of the Vectrex the consoles I was concentrating on are the ones I used to own (or my parents did), which had gone to the great jumble sale (or charity shop) in the sky a long time ago.

Along with a selection of my favourite games for each of these I've also been fitting each console and handheld with a DS flashcard (where applicable), and they ain't cheap. Yesterday, I finally dropped £130 on a SD2SNES Pro. I also got an old Sony LCD for the PSX and PS2 and have recently got a smallish wide-screen LCD (Sony again, just for consistency) for the PS3 and my NintendoWii (which was still in the attic).

Today I've been looking at NES consoles on eBay because it feels like there is a big 8-bit sized gap in my collection! Apart from the Vectrex, this would be the first console that I didn't previously own.

I've converted a small attic room to house the collection (which I've previously posted photos of), which feels like a mini museum.

I have no idea how much I've spent, and am happy not to!",1579095108.0

7nm59f,ds3jnco,1,"I've decided to make 2018 my Retro gaming, and 3DS year. In other words, I will completely devote my self to playing either 3DS titles, or retro gaming titles! 

I have a few games that I already beat in the past, but that I wish to re-live, with some games that I have never beat, that I wish to do so. 

But first a comment on your list, dear OP:

* Dragon Quest VIII and IX, are both gold in my book, even tho VIII is so much more enjoyable with a speed hack (frame skip, on emulator). 

* Seiken Densetsu and Vagrant Story are both masterpieces, and I've only played them half through, and you'll see them on my list too. 

Here comes my list, with 

**Games that I want to replay again**, first:

* Final Fantasy IX - One of my favourite games ever. The Soundtrack, the setting, and the atmosphere are just all top notch. Only thing that I would ever change is Kujas and Zidane's looks, to something less metro. 

* Final Fantasy XII - I know, not really retro, but it's the only other Final Fantasy title that I LOVE, and it is on my top 3 list of best video games of all time. Everything is just perfect in it, the non-standard story, the combat system and side quests, the expansive world, witch is not ""open-world"", yet still feels huge and interesting, and the characters are one of my favorites and represent really well their own backstories. Again, only thing that I would change is the metro look of some of them.

* Dragon Quest VIII and Rogue Galaxy - I am putting them on the same list, because the only PS2 era games that I plan to replay this year.

* Vagrant Story - I never beat it, but I loved the rich combat system of it, and I think it is what inspired FF XII gambits system.

* Legend of Dragoon - loved the story as a kid, I wonder if it will still hold up for me.

**Retro Games that I will attempt to beat for the first time**:

* Legend of Zelda: Windwaker - I find the GameCube to be retro, sue me.

* Xenogears. 

* Terranigma.

* Earthbound (Mother 3).

* SaGa Frontier 2 

* **Legend of Mana** - Currently playing this one, I love it so far!

* Most of the other games in the "" of Mana"" series, regardless of platform.

* The Phantasy Star, Lunar and Shinning Force series's. 

* That one Dragon Warrior (or Dragon Quest) tittle, that spans through multiple generations and takes forever to beat.

That's from the top of my head, for now. I will add as I am finishing those, oh and I will completely devote my self to only retro gaming this year, and I will only one game at a time.

1. NYC

2. Grew up with an Atari 2600, followed by Sega Master System from 1986-1989, dad got a Genesis at launch in August '89, had a Game Boy and Game Gear, traded two Genesis games and $50 for a friend's CIB SNES and 5 games, followed by getting a PS1 in 1997, Sega Saturn in 1998, and imported a Japanese Dreamcast in August '99.

3. Most likely from EGM, as I had a subscription.

4. Yup, got mine during the holiday season of '99 with SNK vs. Capcom: Cardfighters Clash and Dark Arms.

5. I loved the form factor of it, SNK franchises, and fighting games.

6. Friends thought the stick felt great and liked how smooth games looked compared to Game Boy Color.

7. Back then, no. Friends were more interested in GBC and Dreamcast at the time. Now, I know one person who got one recently.

8. I was in denial about it for a few months, hoping more games would get announced but ultimately admitted it to friends. Felt bad for SNK.

9. Picked up a Game Boy Advance and PS2.

10. Had no interest at all in Wonderswan. Owned a Game Boy Color as well and while it had some great games, it had a TON of shovelware and games that looked good on paper but turned out to be total crap.

11. I never really saw much information on it in magazines. There wasn't a lot of advertisement and articles about it were scarce.

12. SNK had great arcade hardware and the Neo Geo home console was truly the first to bring an authentic arcade experience to the living room. They put out a lot of great/iconic games in the 90's and early 2000's. Things sort of went downhill when they merged with Playmore though.

13. The bankruptcy was pretty upsetting but Playmore kept them afloat. The quality of games post-merger were ok at best, nothing really stood out and SNK really only seemed to focus on fighting games at that point.

14. SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millenium, SNK vs. Capcom: Cardfighters Clash, Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure, Dark Arms, Samurai Shodown 2

15. The lack of game genres and third party support. While it had great first party titles, what ultimately killed it was the inability to secure games from other developers and attempting to go head-to-head with Nintendo's beast of a handheld (saleswise).

16. Yup! Still own it to this day, save files for games still intact.

17. No. I owned Truxton for Genesis and that game was mediocre at best.

It had a ton of great games and ports of existing ones. There wasn't much comparison done with the NGPC, it really just couldn't compete.

My dad made owning a Master System pretty awesome, as he ended up buying almost the entire library of games through to 1989, along with the peripherals (sports pad and 3D glasses, system came with the light phaser). I still own everything to this day. I had a couple friends who had Master Systems as well, so we'd swap games now and then. Most classmates had an NES but I think kids were more open-minded back then and didn't really have a problem with who owned an NES and who didn't. I really liked the NES but was fine with never having owned one. The SNES, however, I HAD to have.

I own KoF14 and it's pretty good but I personally found KoF13 on PS3 to be a lot better, although that may just be personal preference. I really liked the 2D character designs and animations, everything looked amazing in that game and played like a dream. KoF14 isn't far of but something about the 3D models and the game's art style feels...hollow? It just feels there's something missing/lacking in it.

They had to move away from sprites, it cost too much and took too long to perfect, it is (for SNK) no longer financially viable. But at least there were a lot of characters to begin with. I suppose it is the lesser of to evils.

> Most classmates had an NES but I think kids were more open-minded back then and didn't really have a problem with who owned an NES and who didn't

That's nice. Having different systems mean that you'll play something new when you go round your mate's. That's something that has been lost with PS vs Xbox, seeing as they're basically the same. It's certainly better than the UK ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64 and Atari ST vs Amiga wars:

Some additonal notes

\- some of these games such as metal gear solid are my personal favorites

\- I play the original jet set radio. never played future but it looks awesome and is a big game suggestion in the jet set radio community!

\- Many people consider the original Resident evil a classic for playstation however it dosnt look too good by todays standards. The gamecube port looks 10x better and keeps most of the core gameplay and elements as opposed to the modern day remasters.

\- if you plan on emulating any of these, then a controller def will makes the experience better! I use a offbrand wired xbox 360 controller but there are also alternatives for a more premium experience. 8bitdo on amazon offers SNES and N64 themed gamepads but the N64 one is a bit costly.

*From /u/NintendoTwizer:*

>How'd you get into game collecting?

I’ve always collected something. From an early age it was pennies, rocks, keys, baseball hats and so on. Displaying and acquiring “collectable” items has always been part of my personality. I’ve also been gaming from a young age. I was never a kid who traded in games when I was done with them, I’d just stick them on my shelf. Everything changed for me when I came across classic gaming forums. I was amazed at the amount of people who were still passionate about these dusty old systems and games. This really sparked my interest. From there I began searching out games online, at thrift stores and garage sales.

>What are your favorites to collect for?

That’s always changing. I have a soft spot in my heart for the NES, since it was my primary system as a child. Gamecube has been really interesting for me as well. As far a Nintendo Consoles go, not a ton of people collect for Gamecube, so in a way it’s been uncharted territory. Currently I’m concentrating on completing a Game Boy set.

>What are some of your gems?

Hmm… I’ve been lucky enough to acquire many of the rares for the different systems. I’m a guy that goes for complete sets, so I have a bit of everything.

As you could guess from my user name I particularly enjoy Nintendo. So maybe not hidden gems or rare titles. But any game with Mario, Metroid or Zelda in it and I’m a happy guy.

>What do you think is the coolest thing about your sub?

The community is fantastic, knowledgeable, friendly and won’t hesitate to help you out. It’s a great place to share your collection, latest finds and thoughts on the future of retro collecting. 

Informationator already mentioned the 3-Minute challenge. That’s pretty neat too it’s a great way to experience these classic games in a new, competitive way.

24r26z,ch9ubqm,2,">Readers are encouraged to share their experience with the game collecting and ask questions about the hobby.

I'll go first. I once loaned part of my collection out to an exhibit, and the Arizona Republic called me for an interview. The girl had her young daughter who was crying. I guess it distracted her from her notes, so my responses came out to be a little silly sounding. 

The true answer is that one of my earliest memories was playing *Missile Command* with my dad when I was about four. That console was stolen when I was about five, so I didn't get a lot of time with it, but it had a big impression one me. I loved video games. 

When I started grade school NES was soaring in popularity. I made new friends and they had this console. It was awesome. My family couldn't afford an NES, but I played all of the classics at the houses of my friends. 

When I was nine my family moved across the country. All I had wanted all year was a Super Nintendo. But my new friends all had a Sega Genesis, so that's what I asked for for Christmas, and that's what I got. In fact, that model 1 is sitting next to my right now, packed in its original box. 

I didn't have a lot of games, but every 90s kid knows that video rental stores were a big things. So while I only ever owned eight Genesis games as a kid, through the magic of rentals and borrowing from my friends, I played most of them. 

From then on I was a big Sega fan. When the 32X came out it was right after my parents divorced, and my mom worked an extra job to get it for me for Christmas. I didn't even get a game for it until my birthday, but it was awesome. 

The next Christmas was the first after my dad died. That year is was a Saturn. I eventually got a NetLink, and through it the awe and wonder of the world wide web and online gaming. I got into gaming communities big time. Wrote for online gaming sites, got to review unreleased software and go to E3. Dreamcast was the first new console I bought for myself. 

I am getting ahead of story, though. Rewinding... When I was 17 I had a job and a car. Game collecting wasn't a big thing yet, so even rare games were pennies at pawn shows and swap meets, and they were abundant. I once paid a dollar for a moving box full of Atari 2600 games. 

I got into collecting out of nostalgia. I bought an Atari 2600, an NES and the games I played at my friends houses, and then all of those Genesis games I rented, and all those cool ones I read about in EGM but couldn't afford. 

Then I got more into it and learned about the history of gaming. I got an Odyssey, a Channel F. I learned about this bad ass console called Vectrex, so I got one of those too. 

And I still collect to this day. 

I love reading the responses from the team over at /r/gamecollecting because when you talk to collectors you learn something new, even if you're like me and you think you already know almost everything. I didn't even know about the Super Wide Boy before today. 

That's why when I was new to Reddit the first subs other than the defaults that I sought out and subscribed to were related to old school gaming, including this sub as well as /r/gamecollecting. 

I've found that other game collectors are some of the nicest people I've ever met, and I think that's really reflected in both this sub and on /r/gamecollecting. 

That's probably enough from me.

The devs of RE2 basically went 'Let's do a pseudo-Final Fantasy/Zelda thing where each new game will take place somewhere different and feature different characters and stories'. It's almost completely been that way ever since sure the games had one or two characters return but they've changed the viruses, stories, and characters around to suit their needs.

>The [Sega Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear)'s Game Genie had a more complicated design than those for other systems. When inserted into the cartridge slot, another slot would pop-up to insert the Game Gear cartridge. It also had a compartment which contained a book of codes. The codes were printed on sticky labels to put on the back of the Game Gear cartridge. When entering codes, the player could easily see what to type in rather than looking through the book.

>On the screen in which a code is entered for the Game Gear Game Genie, a player typing the word ""DEAD"" will cause the screen to move up and down, possibly as an [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media\)).

>Some games do not work with the Game Genie (see ""legal issues"" below).

I never understood the appeal of Mario games. On the surface he looks like a fat middle aged Italian man, he's not an interesting character at all. I couldn't get my head around how Mario was such a massive and much loved franchise.

That all changed a month ago when I finally bought an AV famicom to start at the beginning of so many iconic gaming franchises like Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Castlevania and many others. 

I decided to see what the nearly 40 year long craze of Mario is all about and I started playing Super Mario Bros. I've been hooked ever since. I can't get very far so far. My best is only world 4 - 2 but the learning curve and progression is brutal yet somehow addictive. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I get it now.",1652927441.0
usr3fk,i97ifhi,1,"I never got into the JRPG genre at all until playing FF7 Remake.

I was previously accustomed to CRPGs from the PC, and I was quite snobbish about JRPGs. I thought they were intellectually lowbrow, even outright childish. I made some attempt to play FF7 to see what the hype was about, but I wasn't even really reading the dialogue because I didn't respect the genre. The commentary on environmentalism/capitalism totally flew by me. I got bogged down somewhere in the middle.

That changed when I played FF7 Remake. Then it ""clicked"". I saw that whereas JRPG is not as ""mature"" and as logical as Western CRPGs, it makes up in imagination.

After that I went back and played the FF7 original, which is now one of my all-time faves. And then a bunch of others. I got there late but I am definitely a convert to the genre.",1652971867.0

usr3fk,i95q7qy,1,"For me, the trademark of mario is SIMPLICITY.

Legendary Accessibility and simplicity.

We never hard-loved Super Mario Bros. but Super Mario Bros 3 was our CRACK (there is a interesting documentary about the Mario 3 legendary development) we played mario 3 in the basement all saturday long until we made damn progress!

Bro, to understand how groundbreaking Super Mario bros was go Watch the documentary on Youtube (not about smb3 , about the impact of the original)

What amazing games existed before Mario?

-Pac man

-Donkey Kong

-Mario Bros arcade

-Popeye

-Duck Hunt

-Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest only existed YEARS after Mario!! Same for Konami gems like Castlevania and Contra.

-Super fun fact, Super Mario Bros was so revolutionnary it got the AWARD GAME OF THE YEAR 1985

None of them had that « progression adventure » feeling. NONE OF THEM HAD THE LEGENDARY SIDE SCROLLING. MARIO ITSELF PRETTY MUCH INVENTED THE SIDE SCROLLER GENRE. SO MANY KONAMI GAMES USE IT!

Or the melody when the player dies. 

Or the trio of powerups which was so legendary got copied over and over again (Crash’s mask = extra hit, Crash can have invincibility, sonic can get invincible too. 
Did i say sonic can find a shield to have a second chance too?) and hidden 1-ups.

Also the NES Super Mario anthem (as primitive as it sounds) was the best piece of music ever made for the nes (and gaming in general. Japan started to hum it in the streets in 1986. Thats how crazy Mario was)

usr3fk,i95ccbq,1,"I played the ps1 games as a kid and didn't like them. I don't like the difficulty of a game, coming from not being able to play the game (ie making it harder to move or see). No hate, just my opinion. But then I got a GameCube (during the 360/ps3 era this is). I saw re4 on every list of best GameCube games, bought it, and fell in love. I think its a good blend of not letting u run and gun, but u don't feel clumsy. You aren't op, you're not generally running out of ammo, but u can't just spray bullets everywhere. I love that it's campy but serious at the same time, good blend on that level.


Re2r for ps4 has surpassed it as my favorite re game though. I absolutely love that game.


I gotta say, I'm in the minority. I'm not a fan of re7/biohazard. I don't dig the first person thing, but I also don't like that kind of horror, that Texas chainsaw massacre style of horror. I'm not really into horror in general, but I love that resident evil is kind of b movie, zombie/creature stuff. Re7 became like true, disturbing horror. Which hey, people like it. I'm not against it or anything. Just not my thing. Like watching people get limbs cut off and scream in agony, just not for me.

(If Street Fighter would sell REALLY badly, they would stop supporting the legendary franchise with the amazing care and workforce they put on it. People dont agree with me)

Same with Naughty Dog. I NEVER PLAYED AND DONT WANT TO EVEN GET HOOKED by The Last Of Us (The new AAA playstation IP) 
It’s just focused on Shock factor and torture, human mutilation stuff. 
I personally dont even like EmOTiOnS🤪 in story-telling. It’s the most overpowered brain-dead thing to attract customers. Car ads focus on « being a proud father » and « giving your family happiness » and « Giving your gf her (shallow) dreams » and « buying safety ».

I loved the hardcore gameplay of Crash Bandicoot (why needing a deep plot?😆) and loved Jak and Daxter overall. One of my big brother went Uncharted crazy by buying a PS3 13 years ago but never EVEN TRIED TLOU and when he heard of it he got « meh »

Later He buyed my brother’s PS4 for UNCHARTED 4😆 

I dont know if you share this view, but when i go to some game store, I WANT A DAMN GAME.
Theaters already exists so i can watch movies !?

I know $$$ is almighty, but i dont like the direction most Playstation developers take.

God of War new direction looks more amazing than decent and Ratchet and Clank improve the gameplay roots (while keeping them. Its still look and play like a platformer)

but i dont wanna see Sly Cooper having a existential crysis after stealing a fucking  blueprint. 

Or Parappa the Rapper having a musical transgender discovery quest.

Or a Patapon collective suicide because of body dysmorphia (google Patapon, lol)

Even by making RE having the camera view of Call of Duty, the games aren’t TOO story driven.

4byril,d1dm50m,3,"I hate X, personally. It is indeed a step backward. It is hard as balls and not in a fun way, in my opinion. Castlevania 3 is arguably superior to both in that it offers multiple characters, multiple paths, and a very difficult but fair challenge level. 4 redeems itself by having one of the greatest  soundtracks in the SNES library and the presentation is outstanding for being very early gen SNES.  4 is a game just about anyone could get into without getting overly frustrated.

X is also seen as a poor man's Rondo of Blood which actually features some of those CV3 elements.  ",1458948592.0
4byril,d1dng2k,2,"Dracula X is good but it pales in comparison to scIV. Super castlavania is beautiful, well mapped, perfect gameplay, and a good challenge.

Dracula x on the other hand doesnt look as good, it doesnt control as well and its balls hard. Dracula is nearly impossible to beat, seriously if you beat him its either pure luck or youre just glutton for punishment and stuck with it long enough not to slice your wrists.

But i can one up ya, if you dont already know dracula x is a port of the pc engine classic rondo of blood. Which is one of the top 3 castlevania games on any system. Its pc engine cd only its expensive but can be played on american turbo duo.

I have also Gregory Horror Show on PS2, which I have understood goes for decently high prices, and has been that way even before the COVID spike, as it was a fairly rare game that didn't receive a NTSC release, so US folks were also importing the PAL copies, increasing the price.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

6g6acm,dio3quu,2,"Oldies music carries an expectation of a certain sound, namely early rock and roll, but other categories can fit in too. You can hear a song and say, yup, that's an oldie. Oldies were made generally between the 1950's beginning of rock and roll with songs like ""Rock Around the Clock"" and tapering off around 1970 as a new generation began asserting their own unique identity. Examples are Early Beatles, Chubby Checker, Motown, Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, Elvis Presley, etc. It's a specifically dated period of pop music in particular. Frank Sinatra was turning out music in that time period too, but he had a different sound and audience, and so people don't really call Sinatra's songs oldies, but rather classics or standards. We'll likely never use the term oldie in the future to refer to bygone music again because the term is so strongly associated with that era, and also because our lexicon has evolved and a new trendier word will likely stick that doesn't remind us of the Everly Brothers or Little Richard. 

Similarly, Retro has come to be strongly associated with a certain kind of video game. When we hear Retro, we think of the way video games used to look primarily, but also the way they sounded. Games used to be pixelated, have limited color palettes, depict people in highly stylized forms (so called ""super deformed"" character models, a description I really dislike), lack voice acting and use speech bubbles, use limited animation, etc. The visual style of pretty much any Retro game is based on working with limited resources and hardware. The expectation of how a Retro game should look is summed up perfectly in Retro City Rampage. As hardware and storage media evolved, so did Retro games. The resolution increased, we could render polygons in growing numbers, games jumped into the third dimension, and voice acting became important. It's difficult to draw a line where the Retro term solidly ends because improvements were gradual, but many put it at the fifth generation of consoles. I might argue the sixth because voice acting became common and things like pre rendered backgrounds finally fell into disuse, but that's a different discussion. Just like oldies, I don't think there's going to be a time in the near future where the term Retro won't evoke images of a pixelated Hyrule or Mushroom Kingdom or tinny musical scores. I think there will be a new word for a new era of games if they develop a distinctive new identity, but I think Retro is spoken for. ",1497005843.0
6g6acm,diogxcg,2,"Hearing Nirvana on the classic rock station made me feel old... 

Classics are the greats. Retro is beyond a certain generation (which is debatable, see the 'what generation is considered retro' threads). 

So, I just say I collect video games, old and new. To some, it's retro, to others it's classic, to others it's just old junk (bastards!). 

The definition is going to be moved, changed, interpreted differently by different people. Even when people agree on calling it retro, their timeline for what is retro and what isn't might be different. 

Eventually, Xbox One will be considered retro. Just like Volbeat will be playing on the classic rock stations. ",1497024540.0

I think a lot of people would disagree with that, though.  Hate to make you feel old, but the people who were born the year the PS2 was released are going to be graduating high school this month.  I don't think they picture the same thing we do when they hear the word retro.

Also, a lot of people subscribe to the idea that after 2 generations pass, a generation becomes retro, making the retro category continuously grow.  I personally hate that.

6g6acm,diomb7p,3,"Yeah, I'm getting a little long in the tooth. I've made peace with it lol. The two generation rule is pretty arbitrary but it used to make sense when it was formed. Each generation increased the possibilities of what a game could be up to about the sixth generation, and thereafter we have largely only improved graphics. There are exceptions of course, but there was an explosion of new game mechanics concepts and even whole new genres of games that were impossible until advances were made in hardware. All that slowed down right around the PS2 era and we've been playing the same kinds of games ever since. With largely only cosmetic differences, Halo for the original Xbox plays like pretty much any FPS that is released today. The mechanics are well understood and matured. Games made astonishing advances in the 17 some odd years before the sixth generation, but that 17ish years after that generation hasn't seen nearly the same level of innovation. That's not to belittle the amazing advances in hardware and software development, but game makers are not able to find as many ways to use them to make new kinds of experiences. We kind of are playing the same kinds of games with new coats of paint, with the major difference being online connectivity. 

So what am I getting at being all crotchety and controversial? Well, I would say that if you're playing the same kinds of games as you were before, how can you call that Retro? Sure, graphics and scope have improved, but they play the same. I can recall many games over the years that simply amazed everyone when they were released because absolutely nothing like it had been done before. The transition to 3D was especially ripe with new ways to play and experience a virtual world but there were so many other examples. Retro to me means taking a journey back to how games are no longer made, and it's a really tough thing to do as a younger gamer looking two generations back from PS4. ",1497030384.0

Further to that, why have so few people identified Yooka-Laylee as a ""retro"" game even though it's the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie? Is it because it looks too much like a current game?",1497032783.0
6g6acm,dioy5li,2,"I get your point and agree to an extent, but I think it's more complex than that.  True, there are lots of FPS games that are carbon copies of each other, but there is a lot of innovation as well.  For example Halo, Overwatch, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Fallout, and Metro 2033 are all vastly different from one another.

I also think the scope of games has made them appear more similar to one another.  It takes so much money and manpower to make games as opposed to the past that once a game finds a formula or control that works, others run with it rather than risk trying something new and have it fall flat.

I think that earlier generations up through the Genesis/SNES and maybe even PS1 had games that suffered from one or two weird mechanics that hurt the game.  Now things are more consistent because we've figured out what works.  In the past you could get away with 10 levels, a character with 2 attacks, and the challenge is just getting through the 10 levels without a game over.  Now with the insane amount of content, character models, voice actors, pre-rendered cutscenes, vehicles, multiplayer, enormous sandbox worlds, ect, ect, I think games continue to push boundaries and be amazing, but we mostly take it for granted at this point.",1497043869.0

My top 3 that I still really like:

Mario Land 2 - I've always watched others play it back in the day, but when I finished it myself for the first time not long ago, it still felt really fresh for a Mario game. Good unique concepts and worlds.

Castlevania II Belmont's Revenge - I actually did not play this until the CV collection. But it really feels like a unique and fullfledged Castlevania game. Only the final boss has a weird difficulty spike.

Donkey Kong - I'm not the biggest puzzle guy, but you can't deny the quality here. Especially all the boss levels with DK.

Picking out the games that look decent to me, after looking at them in more detail. Going to separate games loosely by genre. Crossing out the games that, even though they don't make the cut, still do something interesting.

Top spot for me has to go to **Bubsy**. Yeah - it takes a bit to get used to his inertia and the hit box is sort of weird and the levels are a bit too long and repetitive and he's sort of annoying, but dammit - I like it anyway. It's nothing close to my favorite platformer on the system, but I like it well enough.

An odd sort of guilty pleasure is the Japan-only **Sailor Moon: Another Story** RPG. I say ""odd"" because it's one of those games that tend to get immediate negative reactions, for obvious reasons, but there's usually at least one person who's actually played it and chimes in and agrees that it really is a surprisingly good game.

Added because what the hell, as long as I'm here, a couple more in the vein of ""things I generally don't mention because probably people think they suck but they're actually good""...

**Bassin's Black Bass** - a uniquely challenging fishing game.  Unlike most, there's a relatively limited selection of tackle, and you can move the camera out over the water and find fish and target them to cast to them.  That's because the challenge in the game isn't hooking the fish, but landing them.  It has a very nuanced system for line tension and fish strength, and if you try to just haul a lunker in, it'll break the line, but if you ease up too much, it'll slip the hook.  You have to play them - let them run when they want to but don't give them too much slack, then put a bit of pressure on them, get the rod tip up, maybe reel in a bit and hopefully tire them out a bit, but be ready for them to run again.  I've spent at least an hour or so in that game just trying to land one fish.  And it's just so exhilarating to succeed.

**Cool Spot** - just a surprisingly solid platformer, in spite of being corporate advertising.  Solid controls, good attacks and moves, nice level design - just all around much better than should be expected.

Technically, it's **Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another Story**.

The only potential problem with it as a game is that the difficulty curve isn't really a curve - it's sharp peaks and valleys.  When you enter a new area, there's a pretty good chance that you're going to get curbstomped by whatever you meet there.  Healing items are plentiful and fleeing is fairly easy, so it's not an insurmountable obstacle, but it's something you have to deal with.  But after a few levels-up, you'll be fine, and after a few more, you'll likely be curbstomping them.  But by then you're going to be coming up on another set of enemies that can curbstomp you.  And so on.

h9truo,fuzwl04,2,depends on what exactly you're collecting.,1592301771.0
h9truo,fuzxtmi,1,"Pace yourself. 

If you try to buy everything you want immediately then you'll be broke and won't know what to do with everything all at once. 

Let your collection grow naturally and be patient...i was able to get Final Fantasy Mystic Quest in true mint condition CiB for $11 shipped because of 8 months of patience. 

Also, get a good front-end and play stuff before you buy it and it will help you focus on what areas you like best and want to collect in. I, personally, use Coin-OPS Next...others may have other suggestions.

Have your own opinion on things, too, and play/collect what YOU like and not what is popular. I have literally 47 copies of Sewer Shark because I love the game so much. Then there are my 19 copies of Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball.  Many consider those to be trash games...but they've probably never really spent much time with them.  Sewer Shark is a phenomenal game for what it was...actually made in 1986 by John Dykstra and is so much fun if you know how to steer...most don't and end up dying constantly for seemingly no reason so they think it's bad. DoAXVB came out when I was in the middle of me recovering from being left by a truly soulless girl and I would play it every day when I came home from work and just put on the custom soundtracks and play...the game is quite literally just Super Spike V-Ball from NES but with amazing graphics...two buttons and no meters...just relaxing gameplay.  This was also before they went full-on perv mode and the fanservice was actually way less than you'd think in the first X.

That long paragraph was me illustrating my final suggestion...have reasons for what you collect. The best and most interesting conversations you'll have with other collectors is when you see us gush about a game that not really anyone else would gush over and why. I'd wager that the majority of active people on this sub have a copy of Earthbound...it isn't rare...but maybe 1/4 of those people could actually tell you what it is about in any detail because most haven't played it enough to know. Stuff like Earthbound is largely just a trophy.  You'll be a much more happy collector if you have a shelf of 200 $3 games that you love to play so much you can't decide which you want to play more than a single copy of Earthbound CiB for that same $600.

Also...never, ever under any circumstances that aren't family or medical related...EVER pass up the chance to play some couch co-op.  You'll miss it the most when it's not an option, anymore.",1592302968.0
h9truo,fv0f66v,1,"Retro collecting is getting more and more popular (in fact it's a bit of a meme now) so demand is skyrocketing while supply is diminishing.

h9truo,fv197p9,1,"Just collect what you want to play for now. What console are you interested in, I started off with an SNES and from there I got an NES and gameboy. Collect the games you want to play and the consoles you want to play them on (if they’re multi-platform on Nintendo and Sega consoles from the time) what era of gaming do you want to collect from? 70s? 80s? 90s? Early 2000s? What do you want to play on? Choose the console that you want to play games on. Once you have that done, choose the games you want to play. This all depends on budget though of course.

4h4pl6,d2nl8fd,8,"I would honestly go with the SegaCD.

4h4pl6,d2ne1yn,6,"I am probably one of the biggest 32X fans on reddit. But Sega CD has a deeper library. Only like 20 percent of its games are actually FMV. It is true that a lot of the best games are very expensive. Snatcher is one of my favorite games of all time. IMO the second best game I've ever played. It's also insanely pricey now. But there are also a lot of very affordable games, like Sonic CD, Spider-man, and Silpheed. ",1462030814.0
4h4pl6,d2nekeg,4,"Sadly, you're right. The Sega CD is getting more and more expensive these days to get into, but I've always loved a lot of its library (minus the FMV games), but it depends on your tastes. Below are a list of my top games, but some can be quite expensive. One great thing about the Sega CD, once you get a game, burn a CD-R and put the original on a shelf as part of you collection and play the backup, no mods required.

Sonic CD (some people don't care for it, I love it)
Lunar
Lunar II
The Terminator
Batman Returns (the driving parts are a lot of fun)
Popful Mail
Snatcher (super expensive these days)
Vay (not quite Lunar level, but fun)
Earthworm Jim SE (the definitive version IMO)
Eternal Champions
Shining Force CD
Lord of Thunder
Silpheed
Robo Aleste
Heart of the Alien
Final Fight CD
Ecco the Dolphin (music alone makes it)

4h4pl6,d2nh7i6,2,None of them to be honest. For me it's not worth the investment for the lack of games.

4h4pl6,d2nzlub,1,"I like the Sega cd, and the 32x, but it really depends on how much money you want to spend, or if you are going to burn games. I found a 32x for 45 bucks and have not paid above ten bucks, there are a couple of expensive games like knuckles chaotix and a couple of others, but the Sega cd has a better library of games by far, it'll be around $100 nowadays, and if you want legitimate copies of games most ones worth owning go for pretty steep prices especially CIB.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like this is not accurate.  For both of these I feel like you're getting the same port that is on the Genesis, except for a couple extra FMV videos and better sound, but with constant loading times, and minimal to no graphical improvements.

These videos compare the differences ([NBA Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sz6k7MtfCk) and [Mortal Kombat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ0PxXJ1TpI)), and while they both say the Sega CD version is worth it, I disagree coming from the view of if I have a Genesis and want to play these games is it worth it to get the Sega CD to play better versions?  No.  Plus I'd rather have no/minimal loading times and worse sound, than better sound and long loading times.  But maybe that's just me.

kcq9bd,gfsumm2,3,"Going to agree with another comment here that MK on Sega CD was NOT a great port. The SNES version lacking blood and all was still much closer to the arcade. Also I owned a Sega CD as an 11 year old kid when it was current hardware. It was cool and some of the games were excellent, but it had some big shortcomings which included a library that hardly justified its cost.

Keep in mind some of the better games for the system were late releases that were more or less irrelevant when they came out as most consumers had already decided to pass on Sega CD or were moving on from it by then. This included Snatcher, Popful Mail, Fatal Fury Special, Earthworm Jim SE, and others which were released in late 1994/1995 when the hype of Saturn and Playstation was in full swing. That's why those games cost a fortune nowadays: few were made because few were going to purchase them. 

Overall library is fine to look at nowadays, but the timing of those releases is very important as well. A game is only judged as impressive when compared to its contemporaries. Unfortunately for Sega CD owners, SNES already had Donkey Kong Country by the time some of the better Sega CD games came out.",1607943702.0

kcq9bd,gftvc29,1,"We agree with u/IHEARTCHUCKY that Sega CD was ahead of it's time. Folks forget that as an add-on, it gave the Genesis / Mega Drive some amazing audio capabilities in game. Back in the old days we admit to using the Sega CD as our audio CD player when deployed oversees. People also forget that the Sega CD also had sprite enhancement features such as scaling and rotation, similar to that of the Super NES's Mode 7. It also pushed some decent 3D polygons in games like Silpheed and Star Wars Rebel Assault. At the time, Sega CD also had the best ports of Final Fight and NBA Jam, and remained our go-to when U.S. idiot decision makers failed the Japanese RPG gamer market.

So let's look at idiot decision makers a bit deeper... It was through their mismanagement that we got the gluttony of FMV games. They also set too high of a retail price (for an add-on mind you!) to get market penetration. And their greatest sin? Sega was slow to distribute the development kits needed to create Sega CD games, which delayed third party software support. The result caused some rushed low quality games and simple slightly enhanced versions of their existing Genesis \\ Mega Drive carts. This all took place in the piss poor communication days that eventually led to the fall of Sega as a hardware manufacturer",1607966589.0

It was really cool to own when I was a kid, and there were definitely a few fantastic games in there, but it also felt like it had a higher proportion of garbage games than the genesis and SNES. There also weren't enough games that actually took real advantage of the hardware beyond simply offering better sound. I was also disappointed that the hardware did not increase the color palette of games. 

Still, i had a lot of fun with Monkey Island, NHL 94, FIFA, and a few other games. Also, I see that you bashed cliffhanger, but the snowboarding levels, which were exclusive to the Sega CD and very similar to the driving levels in Batman, were actually a ton of fun.

-	Magic Pockets (early 90s Acorn Archimedes platformer. Also on Amiga I think)

mz8xtp,gvzfcij,1,"So it seems to me really what we're looking at here *isn't* games that *nobody remembers*, but rather games with the greatest difference between the number of *people who experienced them* (on the one hand) and the number of *people who remember them* (on the other).  
  
Because I could go on all day about various great games almost nobody remembers.  But that's just because they're great games almost nobody experienced.  Late 80s Coleco Adam or TI-99/4A games, for example.  Released into a community of hundreds, rather than millions.  There's pretty much a 1-to-1 correlation between how few people remember a game and how many people originally played it.  
  
But I think we're instead looking for the **most forgotten** games.  The ones **millions played**, and almost immediately ceased to take any interest in at all, such that they mostly vanished from our collective memory.  
  
In that department, I think the most remarkably forgotten games are the ones which were so utterly generic and universal to an era that by virtue of being everywhere, they aren't particular to anything, and so we just don't talk about them, later on.  By being equally relevant to everything, they aren't particularly relevant to anything.  
  
So for example, the Star Trek microcomputer games which were **absolutely everywhere** in the 1977-1983 era.  Literally everything with a screen and some kind of processor had a Star Trek BASIC game that most people on the platform played.  These were among the most popular games, for the early microcomputers.  
  
But because these things were absolutely everywhere and weren't uniquely representative of any one platform, they're mostly not talked about when people talk about any of the systems that played them.  
  
So that's an example for me for how a game can be *one of the most played and most popular games for a system* and, then, with the passing of time and with the system passing into memory, *almost never talked about in connection with that system*.  
  
Because people tend to focus on what's particular and unique to the system and the legacy, later on.  
  
So the bizarre irony is that a game played by millions on hundreds of systems *isn't very memorable*, precisely because it was played by millions on hundreds of systems.",1619475804.0

cyn3qy,eytp0ha,1,"Ape Escape still plays very well, probably partially thanks to it's simple camera system, and how essential it was to nail the stick controls for the game to work. Left stick is for movement, right is for gadget controls (so, in which way you swing your attack, driving an RC car, rotation for a few other gadgets), camera follows you pretty well but you can focus it in front of you by pressing R1. L1 is for jumping, face buttons are quick selects for the gadgets.

Honestly, I think the first game feels and maybe even controls slightly better than the sequels, but the sequels still use the same control scheme, so it definitely held the test of time.

Mickey's Wild Adventure. Simple 2D platformer, very responsive and simple controls, smooth gameplay.

Toy Story 2 still plays pretty well for such an old 3D platformer. Jumping is very pleasant. Though, Tarzan and Hercules games had kinda slugish controllers from what I remember. Not too bad, but I think they are much more ""standard"". Tarzan especially feels kinda delayed.

I haven't played Stuart Little 2 too much, but I remember it controlled similarly well to Toy Story 2.

Rayman 1 and 2 both control pretty well from what I can remember.

Mortal Kombat Trilogy should feel reasonably good, but not as good as the newer games.

This one can be debated, but Quake 2 for an early 3D console shooter is fine. Framerate isn't super stable, but right stick aiming felt pretty quick and snappy, though there isn't any type of aim smoothing, and the biggest flaw with this PS1 port is that you can't use both sticks at the same time. For some reason, they allow 3-4 different configurations, one of them uses left stick to move but aiming is done via shoulder buttons and face buttons IIRC, but the best option has you using arrow keys to move and right stick to aim. I found my playthrough pretty pleasant, at least when I started using a better controller with better condition D-pad.

That's all I can think of.",1567442158.0
cyn3qy,eytfgng,0,"I advise against Klonoa. Many of the ""gems"" lists are often games that are missing the quality that makes them special. There's a reason why hidden gems were often overlooked during their times. Watch about twenty minutes to a half hour of gameplay and then make your decision.
